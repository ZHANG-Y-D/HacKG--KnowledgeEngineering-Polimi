The music will also vary by the number of people in the room; rooms with more people in it will get more instrumental music and less lyrics, so as to not disturb a conversation. Rooms with a lot of people will receive more dance music, as a way to detect and appropriately entertain a party.", "hackathon-url": "https://hackrpi2015.devpost.com/", "project-title": "chaplin", "project-inspiration": "", "project-lessons-learned": "", "project-accomplishments": "", "project-likes": "4", "hackathon-name": "HackRPI", "project-subtitle": "Music based on your emotions and social situation", "project-github-url": "https://github.com/chickenbellyfinn/chaplin", "project-number-of-comments": "0", "team-size": "1", "project-creation-timestamp": "2015-11-15T11:27:38-05:00", "team": [{"participant-bubble": "i made it", "participant-name": "", "participant-desc": "", "participant-url": ""}], "project-url": "https://devpost.com/software/chaplin", "project-id": "46761"}
