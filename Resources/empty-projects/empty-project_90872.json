It seems like you should be able to \"just list WiFi networks\", but first you have to discover and list all available network devices attached to the computer, determine which ones are WiFi, scan that particular device for access points, merge access points for the same ESSID into one object, and allow the user to connect to that \"object\" based on the access point with the best connection strength. Oh, and this GUI needs to be written against multiple different backends because different users have different system setups and NetworkManager and WICD are almost perfectly tied in number of users. Oh and don't forget to list Wired and Bluetooth and VPN network devices too!
