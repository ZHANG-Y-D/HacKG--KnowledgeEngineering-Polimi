Using a Raspberry Pi, a bear LCD screen, a high power LED, and various lenses, I created a projector that would use an OSMC operating system on my Raspberry Pi to display audio and video content via a wireless Airplay signal. In a small cardboard box, the LCD would display the content, and a high power LED would make the screen very luminous so the lens could capture and project the image onto any wall.", "project-lessons-learned": "", "project-accomplishments": "", "project-likes": "0", "hackathon-name": "", "project-subtitle": "A projector that uses my Pi to display video content via an Airplay device.", "project-github-url": "", "project-number-of-comments": "0", "team-size": "1", "project-creation-timestamp": "2016-08-16T17:17:00-04:00", "team": [{"participant-bubble": "", "participant-name": "", "participant-desc": "", "participant-url": ""}], "project-url": "https://devpost.com/software/diy-projector", "project-id": "68280"}
