As a result, using an Arduino UNO, a relay, an IR receiver, and power strip, I created a power outlet that would be connected to my Arduino using a relay and controlled the Arduino via an IR Blaster. Now whenever I plug an electrical item into my strip, I can control it using a remote with buttons programmed to turn the item on or off.", "project-lessons-learned": "", "project-accomplishments": "", "project-likes": "0", "hackathon-name": "", "project-subtitle": "I made a power strip that can be controlled via Wifi", "project-github-url": "", "project-number-of-comments": "0", "team-size": "1", "project-creation-timestamp": "2016-08-16T19:22:25-04:00", "team": [{"participant-bubble": "", "participant-name": "", "participant-desc": "", "participant-url": ""}], "project-url": "https://devpost.com/software/lamp-remote", "project-id": "68284"}
