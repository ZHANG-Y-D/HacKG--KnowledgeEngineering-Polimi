Maker understands and agrees that FMNA¡¯s use of material containing features or elements similar or identical to those contained in Maker¡¯s Submission will not obligate FMNA to negotiate with Maker or entitle Maker to any compensation if FMNA determines that it has an independent legal right to use that other material for any reason (for example, because the features or elements are not new or novel, were not originated by Maker, or were or may hereafter be independently created and submitted by other persons, including FMNA employees).\n\nBy entering, all Makers (including, in the case of a team, all participating members) agree to be bound by the Official Rules and hereby release the Released Parties from any and all liability in connection with the Prizes or Maker¡¯s participation in the Hackathon.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO MAKER. All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of these Official Rules, Maker's rights and obligations, or the rights and obligations of the sponsor in connection with the Hackathon, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of State of California, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction), which would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than State of California.\n?\nWhat Other Terms is the Maker agreeing to under these Hackathon Official Rules?\nBy entering this Hackathon, Maker agrees:\n?\nPlease review the FMNA website terms of service (¡°Terms of Service¡±).\n?\nThe above shall apply to Maker¡¯s participation in the Hackathon and more generally Maker¡¯s use of FMNA¡¯s website(s).
