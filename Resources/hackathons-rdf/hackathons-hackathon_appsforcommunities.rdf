<http://www.semanticweb.org/hezhang/ontologies/2021/6/Hackathon#appsforcommunities> <http://www.semanticweb.org/hezhang/ontologies/2021/6/Hackathon#hackathon-rules> "\nThe Apps for Communities Challenge is an initiative of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation (¡°Knight Foundation¡±) and the Federal Communications Commission (¡°FCC¡±). ?The goals of the Challenge are to: make local public information more personalized, usable, and accessible for all Americans; promote broadband adoption, particularly among Americans who are less likely to be regular Internet users (including low-income, rural, residents on Tribal lands, seniors, people with disabilities, and the low digital/English literacy communities); and create better links between Americans and services provided by local, state, Tribal and federal governments.? The Challenge is intended to bring together providers of public data, developers, and traditionally underserved populations through a national contest for innovative uses of local data, and to provide recognition to contestants who develop software applications (apps) that provide easy access to relevant content with an emphasis on apps that use hyper-local and other public data from cities, counties, townships, Tribes and states.\nThe FCC seeks to promote broadband deployment and adoption for all Americans -- regardless of geography, race, economic status, disability, residence on Tribal land, or degree of digital or English literacy -- by providing easy access to relevant content.? New applications can pull new users online, as well as increase the value of broadband connections for existing users. ?Together, increased broadband adoption and deployment can be indispensable for unleashing innovation and investment, spurring job creation and economic growth, and ensuring our country's global competitiveness.\nConsistent with Knight Foundation¡¯s mission to foster informed and engaged communities and the FCC¡¯s goal to encourage broadband adoption and deployment, the FCC and Knight Foundation are co-sponsoring this Challenge, offering $100,000 in prizes.? The Knight Foundation is the Challenge Administrator and has contracted with Clay Johnson and Fission Strategy to conduct this Challenge. While the Challenge is locally focused, the FCC and Knight Foundation want the apps created to be usable across jurisdictions throughout theUnited States.\n\n\nThe Challenge is open only to: (1) Citizens or permanent residents of the fifty (50) United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, who are at least thirteen (13) years old at the time of entry; and (2) private entities that are incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States, including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. An individual may participate on behalf of more than one team, corporation, or nonprofit organization. ?Employees of the FCC, Knight Foundation and its contractors, Clay Johnson and Fission Strategy, and members of their immediate households, are not eligible.? Federal entities and federal employees acting within the scope of their employment are not eligible. ?Participation in this Challenge constitutes the Contestant's full and unconditional agreement to these official rules. \n?
