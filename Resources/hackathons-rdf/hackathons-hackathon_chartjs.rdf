Use of an automated process or similar device to submit an electronic vote is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to circumvent the one-vote limit per Submission, including the use of multiple email addresses or any form of automated vote processes will subject all votes from the person or entity to disqualification. The Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any Contestant at their sole discretion, if a Contestant receives multiple and/or irregular votes from the same user or users, or receives votes in a manner that otherwise may indicate automated or non-automated vote manipulation. If the voting process for the Popular Choice Award fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, the Sponsor at their sole discretion reserves the right to determine the winner by using non-suspect votes, or by any other means the Sponsor deems appropriate.? If no alternative means of determining a winner of the Popular Choice Award is available, the Sponsor may eliminate the Popular Choice Award. Contestants may not pay or otherwise compensate anyone or provide any other type of consideration in exchange for votes.\nA.

Winners (and in the case of team, all participating members) are responsible for reporting and paying all applicable federal, state, and local taxes. It is the sole responsibility of Prize winners of US$600 or more to provide certain information to facilitate receipt of the award, including completing and submitting any tax forms when necessary and any applicable withholding and reporting requirements.\nA. Each Contestant hereby acknowledges and agrees that the relationship between the Contestant, the Sponsor, is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other special relationship, and that the Contestant¡¯s decision to provide the Contestant¡¯s Submission to Sponsor for the purposes of this Competition does not place the Sponsor and their respective agents in a position that is any different from the position held by the members of the general public with regard to elements of the Contestant¡¯s Submission, except as specifically provided in these Official Rules.?\nB. By entering, each Contestant (including, in the case of team, all participating members) agree(s) to:?\n(i) comply with and be bound by these Official Rules and the decisions of the Sponsor and/or the Competition judges which are binding and final in all matters relating to this Competition; and??\n(ii) release, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sponsor, and their respective parent, subsidiary, and affiliated companies, the Prize suppliers and any other organizations responsible for sponsoring, fulfilling, administering, advertising or promoting the Competition, and all of their respective past and present officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives (hereafter the ¡°Released Parties¡±) from and against any and all claims, expenses, and liabilities (including reasonable attorneys¡¯ fees), including but not limited to negligence and damages of any kind to persons and property, defamation, slander, libel, violation of right of publicity, infringement of trademark, copyright or other intellectual property rights, property damage, or death or personal injury arising out of or relating to a Contestant¡¯s entry, creation of Submission or entry of a Submission, participation in the Competition, acceptance or use or misuse of the Prize (including any travel or activity related thereto) and/or the broadcast, transmission, performance, exploitation or use of Submission as authorized or licensed by these Official Rules.?\nC.

The Sponsor¡¯s failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. The Sponsor is not responsible for incomplete, late, misdirected, damaged, lost, illegible, or incomprehensible Submissions or for address or email address changes of the Contestants. Proof of sending or submitting will not be deemed to be proof of receipt by Sponsor.
