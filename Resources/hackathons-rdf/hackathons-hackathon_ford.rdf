Use of an automated process or similar device to submit an electronic vote is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to circumvent the one-vote limit per Submission, including the use of multiple email addresses or any form of automated vote processes will subject all votes from the person or entity to disqualification. The Sponsor and/or the Administrator reserves the right to disqualify any Contestant at their sole discretion, if a Contestant receives multiple and/or irregular votes from the same user or users, or receives votes in a manner that otherwise may indicate automated or non-automated vote manipulation. If the voting process for the Popular Choice Award fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, the Sponsor and/or the Administrator at their sole discretion reserve the right to determine the winner by using non-suspect votes, or by any other means the Administrator deems appropriate.?

In the event of a tie between or among two or more Submissions for the Personal Fuel-Efficiency Recognition Award, the winning Submission shall be determined by the Tie-Breaker Criteria.\nC. The likelihood of a Large Organization being selected to win the Personal Fuel-Efficiency Recognition Award depends on the number and quality of eligible Submissions made by Large Organizations.\nA.
