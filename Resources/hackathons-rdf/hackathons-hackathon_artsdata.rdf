Like every other organization, business, or government agency, we rely on data to tell us how to serve our mission more effectively. The Survey of Public Participation in the Arts (SPPA) is the NEA's flagship dataset and includes a host of demographic, geographic, and behavioral variables about U.S. adults (ages 18 and over) and how they participate in arts activities. Last fielded in 2012, the nationally representative survey has occurred six times since 1982."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string>.

Designs must be your original work, and must not violate or infringe the rights of other parties, including but not limited to privacy, publicity, or intellectual property rights, or material that constitutes copyright or license infringement. Your design may not contain any material that is inappropriate, indecent, obscene, hateful, defamatory, or in any way disparaging. Your design cannot have been submitted previously in another promotion or contest of any kind.\nAll visualizations or applications submitted to the NEA Challenge remain the intellectual property of the individuals or organizations that developed them.

The reservation of NEA rights to authorize use of the Submission by the public includes the Contestant¡¯s assent to NEA¡¯s release of the application under an open-source software license, if NEA so chooses. The Contestant agrees to execute a separate license with NEA, as appropriate, for such purposes.\nContestant represents and warrants that he or she is the sole author and copyright owner of the Submission, and that the Submission is an original work of the Contestant, or if the Submission is a work based on an existing application, that the Contestant has acquired sufficient rights to use and to authorize other¡¯s use of the Submission, including NEA¡¯s, as specified in the ¡°Intellectual Property Rights¡± section of the Rules; and that the Submission does not infringe upon any copyright or upon any other third party rights of which the Contestant is aware, and that the Submission is free of malware.\nThe Chairman of NEA will appoint a panel of qualified judges to select the winner of the \"Presenting Arts Data Artfully\" data visualization challenge. The panel comprises two distinguished individuals from outside NEA and two NEA employees selected for their expertise in the fields of data, visualization, and design.\nBefore providing any submissions to the panel of judges, NEA staff members will initially review all submissions to ensure that they are minimally competitive and that judges can apply the criteria described below. To ensure that the judging process is fair and impartial, judges will conduct a blind review of and select from the top 10 applications that the NEA determines are most competitive.\nJudges may not (A) have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer, director, or agent of any entity that is a registered participant in a competition; or (B) have a familial or financial relationship with an individual who is a registered participant.?\nJudges will evaluate the submissions on the basis of the following criteria:\nThe decisions of the judges will be virtually announced on or about March 10 on Challenge.gov and/or ChallengePost.com.\nExcept where prohibited, participation in the Competition constitutes each winner¡¯s consent to NEA¡¯s and its agents' use of each winner's name, likeness, photograph, voice, opinions, and/or hometown and state information for promotional purposes through any form of media, worldwide, without further payment or consideration.\nRegistered participants shall be required to agree to assume any and all risks and waive claims against the Federal Government and its related entities, except in the case of willful misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of property, revenue, or profits, whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising from their participation in a competition, whether the injury, death, damage, or loss arises through negligence or otherwise.
