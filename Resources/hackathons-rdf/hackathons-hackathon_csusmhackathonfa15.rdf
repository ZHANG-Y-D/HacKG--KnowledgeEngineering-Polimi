Being in foster care is traumatic and these children, who have already experienced abuse and/or neglect, face moving around a lot and many school changes while in foster care. Former foster youth also have challenges as young adults including homelessness, mental health issues, unemployment, and incarceration. Due to these and many other challenges, the educational attainment rates for former foster youth are extremely low. In a California study, 75% of foster youth dream of going to college, but do not think they have the opportunity nor do they have support to navigate and prepare for the process. It is estimated that only 3% of former foster youth obtain their 4-year college degree compared to 28% of the general population.?\n\n\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge 2: Safe Care for Elderly? (sponsored by the\nTen thousand (10,000) people turn 65 every day and this will continue for the next 18 years.? In conjunction with this age wave, humans are living much longer than ever before.? With advanced age comes an increased need for dependency and caregiving services.? More families are finding that geographic distances along with work and family responsibilities make 24/7 caregiving for parents and/or spouses a significant challenge.? Assisted living facilities provide assistance and supervision to the elderly who can no longer independently care for themselves.? Families searching for a care facility want to locate a safe place for their loved one, typically within driving distance so they can visit regularly.? Locating a quality facility, however, is currently cumbersome and time-consuming.? Buried in the state¡¯s filing cabinets are narratives on facility deficiencies for abuse, neglect, isolation, malnutrition, dehydration, theft and other personal rights violations.? But transparency is slowly improving.? This year, for the first time ever, California¡¯s Department of Social Services displays on its website individual assisted living facility inspection data (i.e. citation totals, dates and number of inspections and complaints, etc.) for all of the approximately 8,000 assisted living facilities in the state.?\n\nThe following resources provide facility profile information (name, address, etc.) as well as citation data:\nCalifornia Department of Social Services (Elderly Assisted Living)\nCalQualityCare.org (Assisted Living)\n\n\nThe Scan Foundation, Long-Term Care Fundamentals:\nCity-Data.com\nGoogle Maps\nCARR website\n?\nAssisted living facilities are not skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes or rehabilitation centers."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string>.
