A PURCHASE OR PAYMENT OF ANY KIND WILL NOT INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF WINNING.\n: 2016 GBIF Ebbe Nielsen Challenge (the ¡°Challenge¡±)\n: http://gbif2016.devpost.com (the ¡°Challenge Website¡±)\nAdministrator (the ¡°Administrator¡±):\nGBIF Secretariat\nUniversitetsparken 15\nDK-2100 K?benhavn ?\nDenmark\nThe Administrator is the sponsor and entity responsible for the Challenge.\n: July 29 2016 (1200 Central European Summer Time | UTC +2) ¨C 1?Oct 2016 (0000 CEST) (the ¡°Submission Period¡±)\n: 3 Oct 2016 (0900 CEST) ¨C 23 Oct 2016 (1700 CEST) (the ¡°Judging Period¡±)\n: 26 Oct 2016 (1200 Bras¨ªlia Time UTC -3)\nThe Administrator will be the official timekeeper for the Challenge.\n(The above are collectively, ¡°Makers¡±)\nAn individual may join more than one team or Organization, and an individual who is part of a team or Organization may also enter the Challenge on an individual basis.\nIf participating in a team, the team must appoint and authorize one individual (the ¡®Representative¡¯) to represent, act, and enter a Submission, on their behalf. The Representative must meet the eligibility requirements above. By entering a Submission on the Site on behalf of a team or organization, you represent and warrant that you are the Representative, and are duly authorized to act on behalf of your team or organization. The Representative shall act on behalf of the team to assume all rights and responsibilities regarding the challenge. If a team entry is selected as a winning entry, GBIF will pay prize money to the Representative, who will bear the responsibility of distributing the prize money to team members.\nMakers must do the following to participate in the Challenge:\nAll Submission materials must be in English or, if not in English, the Maker must provide an English translation of the demonstration video, text description, and testing instructions as well as all other materials submitted.\n: Makers must use GBIF-mediated data in way that produces new representations or insights. Submissions may involve a range of results¡ªwebsites, stand-alone or mobile applications, or outputs of analyses¡ªor may seek to improve issues or processes including (but not limited to) data analysis or visualization, data workflows, uploading, or annotations.\nThe judges must be able to access the submission at no cost or perform the same analysis/visualization using comparable alternative sources of data.\nIf the submission is a stand-alone application then it must operate on hardware readily available to the judges.\nIf the submission is a mobile app then the submission must enable the judges to access the solution, either by making it publicly available in an app store, by sending the .apk file (Android), or making it available using TestFlight (iOS).\nIf the submission is the output of an analysis then the analysis must be repeatable, with the submission including sufficient detail for repetition.\n: While submissions need not rely exclusively on GBIF as a data source, they must, in the judgement of the Challenge jury and GBIF Secretariat staff, make significant use GBIF-mediated data. Rather than prescribe specific amounts or relative proportions of data, the Challenge organizers expect that qualifying submissions would apply GBIF-mediated data in ways that reasonable observers would consider measurable, meaningful, and important.\n: The submission should be ¡°novel¡± in that a significant portion of the submission should be developed for the challenge. A submission based largely (or entirely) on work published or developed prior to the challenge start date will not be eligible for submission.\n: In light of GBIF¡¯s commitment to open-access data¡ªmost recently recognized in GBIF¡¯s plans around data licensing¡ªwe encourage participants to adopt the most open licences possible for their Challenge submissions. However, each submission will remain the property of its participants, unless otherwise specified. By entering a Submission, the Makers agree to grant GBIF a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use it.\n: A Maker may submit more than one Submission, however, each Submission must be unique and substantially different from the others, as determined by the Administrator.\n: The text description should explain the insights represented in the submission; the GBIF-mediated (and, if any, other) data used; and the process and method used in order to complete the submission, including the tools and algorithms used.\n: The Submission¡¯s visual elements should demonstrate its insights or functionality.\nIf video is included, the video clip:\nRegardless of the format used, these visual elements must be freely accessible to the judges, whether uploaded through an external video hosting service like YouTube or Vimeo or posted as a zip archive to a cloud-based file-sharing service like Dropbox, Box, or OneDrive.\nSubject to the licenses described below, any applicable intellectual property rights to a Submission will remain with the Maker.\nBy entering the Challenge, you grant to the Administrator, and any other third parties acting on the Poster¡¯s behalf, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide perpetual license to display publicly and use for promotional purposes the Submission, in perpetuity. This license includes, but is not limited to, posting or linking to the Submission on Administrator¡¯s, and partners¡¯ websites and applications, including the Challenge Website, and display and promotion of the Submission in any other media, worldwide.\nThe following Submission components may be displayed to the public: name, description, images, video URL, website URL, team members (username only), the Submission category and platform, and submitter type. Other Submission materials may be viewed by the Administrator and Judges for screening and evaluation.\nMakers represent and warrant that the Administrator and Challenge partners are free to use Makers¡¯ Submission in the manner described above, as provided or as modified by Administrator, without obtaining permission or license from any third party and without any compensation to Makers.\nEligible Submissions will be evaluated by a panel of judges selected by the Administrator (the ¡°Judges¡±), and scored using the following equally weighted criteria (the ¡°Judging Criteria¡±):\nJudges are not required to test the Application and may choose to judge based solely on the text description and video or screenshots provided in the Submission.\nIf two or more Submissions are tied, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first applicable criterion listed above will be considered the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions¡¯ scores on the next applicable criterion. If two or more Submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Submissions.\nTHE AWARD OF A PRIZE TO A POTENTIAL WINNER IS SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION OF THE IDENTITY, QUALIFICATIONS AND ROLE OF THE POTENTIAL WINNER IN THE CREATION OF THE SUBMISSION. The final decision to designate a winner shall be made by the Administrator.\nPotential winners will be notified using the email address associated with the DevPost account used to enter the Submission (the submitter is the ¡°Representative¡± in the case of a team or Organization). In order to receive a Prize, the potential winner (including all participating team members in the case of a team or Organization) will be required to sign and return to the Administrator, declaration(s) of eligibility (or a similar verification document) and liability/publicity release(s), and any applicable tax forms (¡°Required Forms¡±).\nDeadline for Returning Required Forms: ten (10) business days after the Required Forms are sent.\nThe Administrator may deem a potential winner (or participating team members) ineligible to win if:\nIn the event of a disqualification, the Administrator may award the applicable Prize to an alternate potential winner.\nThe Administrator has the right to make a Prize substitution of equivalent or greater value. The Administrator will not award a Prize if there are no eligible Submissions entered in the Challenge, or if there are no eligible Makers or Submissions for a specific Prize.\nA monetary Prize will be mailed to the winning Maker¡¯s address (if an individual) or the Representative¡¯s address (if a team or Organization) after receipt of the Required Forms. Prizes will be payable to the Maker, if an individual, to the Maker¡¯s Representative, if a team, or to the Organization, if the Maker is an Organization. It will be the responsibility of the winning Maker¡¯s Representative to allocate the Prize among their team¡¯s members, as the Representative deems appropriate.\nWithin 45 days of the Administrator¡¯s receipt of the Required Form\nWinners (and in the case of team or Organization, all participating members) are responsible for reporting and paying all applicable taxes in their jurisdiction of residence (federal, state/provincial/territorial and local). Winners are also responsible for complying with foreign exchange and banking regulations in their respective jurisdictions and reporting the receipt of the Prize to relevant government departments/agencies, if necessary.\nA.

Proof of sending or submitting will not be deemed to be proof of receipt by the Administrator.\nIf for any reason any Maker¡¯s Submission is determined to have not been received or been erroneously deleted, late, lost, or otherwise destroyed or corrupted, the Maker¡¯s sole remedy is to request the opportunity to resubmit its Submission. Such request must be made promptly after the Maker knows or should have known there was a problem, and will be determined at the sole discretion of the Administrator.\nBy participating in the Challenge you consent to the use of personal information about you, if you are a winner, by the Administrator, and third parties acting on their behalf. Such personal information includes, but is not limited to, your name, likeness, photograph, voice, opinions, comments and hometown and country of residence.

If at any time prior to the deadline, a Maker or prospective Maker believes that any Official Rule is or may be unclear or ambiguous, they must submit a written request for clarification.\nG. The Administrator¡¯s failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. Should any provision of these Official Rules be or become illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction whose laws or regulations may apply to a Maker, such illegality or unenforceability shall leave the remainder of these Official Rules, including the Rule affected, to the fullest extent permitted by law, unaffected and valid. The illegal or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid and enforceable provision that comes closest and best reflects the Administrator¡¯s intention in a legal and enforceable manner with respect to the invalid or unenforceable provision.\nH.
