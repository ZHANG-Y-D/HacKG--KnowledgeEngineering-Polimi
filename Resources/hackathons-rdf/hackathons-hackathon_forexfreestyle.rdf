Each Contestant hereby acknowledges and agrees that the relationship between the Contestant, the Sponsor and the Administrator, is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other special relationship, and that the Contestant¡¯s decision to provide the Contestant¡¯s Submission to Sponsor and Administrator for the purposes of this Competition does not place the Sponsor, the Administrator, and their respective agents in a position that is any different from the position held by the members of the general public with regard to elements of the Contestant¡¯s Submission, except as specifically provided in these Official Rules.\nA. By entering, each Contestant (including, in the case of team, Organization and Large Organization, all participating members) agree(s) to:\n(i) comply with and be bound by these Official Rules and the decisions of the Sponsor, Administrator, and/or the Competition judges which are binding and final in all matters relating to this Competition;?\n(ii) release, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sponsor, Administrator, and their respective parent, subsidiary, and affiliated companies, the Prize suppliers and any other organizations responsible for sponsoring, fulfilling, administering, advertising or promoting the Competition, and all of their respective past and present officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives (hereafter the ¡°Released Parties¡±) from and against any and all claims, expenses, and liabilities (including reasonable attorneys¡¯ fees), including but not limited to negligence and damages of any kind to persons and property, defamation, slander, libel, violation of right of publicity, infringement of trademark, copyright or other intellectual property rights, property damage, or death or personal injury arising out of or relating to a Contestant¡¯s entry, creation of Submission or entry of a Submission, participation in the Competition, acceptance or use or misuse of the Prize (including any travel or activity related thereto) and/or the broadcast, transmission, performance, exploitation or use of Submission as authorized or licensed by these Official Rules.?\nB. Without limiting the foregoing, the Released Parties shall have no liability in connection with:\n(i) any incorrect or inaccurate information, whether caused by the Sponsor¡¯s, the Administrator¡¯s or a Contestant¡¯s electronic or printing error or by any of the equipment, including the ForexConnect API,or programming associated with or utilized in the Competition;\n(ii) technical failures of any kind, including, but not limited to malfunctions, interruptions, or disconnections in phone lines, internet connectivity or electronic transmission errors, or network hardware or software or failure of the Competition Website;\n(iii) unauthorized human intervention in any part of the entry process or the Competition;\n(iv) technical or human error which may occur in the administration of the Competition or the processing of Submissions; or\n(v) any injury or damage to persons or property which may be caused, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from the Contestant¡¯s participation in the Competition or receipt or use or misuse of any Prize. If for any reason any Contestant¡¯s Submission is confirmed to have been erroneously deleted, lost, or otherwise destroyed or corrupted, the Contestant¡¯s sole remedy is to request the opportunity to resubmit its Submission, which request will be determined at the sole discretion of the Sponsor and the Administrator if the Competition Submission Period is still open.?\nParticipation in the Competition constitutes a winner¡¯s consent to Sponsor¡¯s, and their agents¡¯ use of the winner¡¯s name, likeness, photograph, voice, opinions, comments and/or hometown and state of residence (and, as applicable, those of all other members of the team, Organization or Large Organization which participated in the Submission) for promotional purposes in any media, worldwide, without further payment or consideration, for a period of two years following the conclusion of the Competition.?\nA. Sponsor and Administrator reserve the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify the Competition, or any part of it, if any fraud, technical failure or any other unanticipated factor or factor beyond Sponsor¡¯s and Administrator¡¯s control impairs the integrity or proper functioning of the Competition, as determined by Sponsor and Administrator at their sole discretion. The Sponsor and Administrator reserve the right at their sole discretion to disqualify any individual or Contestant it finds to be tampering with the entry process (for example by using the aid of computer software programs to auto-fill entries) or the operation of the Competition or to be acting in violation of these Official Rules or in a manner that is inappropriate, not in the best interests of this competition, or a violation of any applicable law or regulation.?\nB. Any attempt by any person to undermine the proper conduct of the Competition may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, the Sponsor and the Administrator reserve the right to take proper legal action, including, without limiting, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unlawful activities.?\nC. The Sponsor and/or the Administrator¡¯s failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. The Sponsor and the Administrator are not responsible for incomplete, late, misdirected, damaged, lost, illegible, or incomprehensible Submissions or for address or email address changes of the Contestants. Proof of sending or submitting will not be deemed to be proof of receipt by Sponsor or Administrator. The Sponsor and the Administrator are not responsible for, nor are they required to count any vote which, in their sole judgment, is incomplete, late, misdirected, damaged, unlawful or illicit, including those secured through payment, votes achieved through automated means, as well as those lost for technical reasons, defective or otherwise in violation of these rules.?\nD. In the event of any discrepancy or inconsistency between the terms and conditions of the Official Rules and disclosures or other statements contained in any Competition materials, including but not limited to the Competition Submission form, Competition Website, or point of sale, television, print or online advertising, the terms and conditions of the Official Rules shall prevail.?\nE. The Sponsor and the Administrator reserve the right, without liability, to amend the terms and conditions of the Official Rules at any time, including the rights or obligations of the Contestant, the Sponsor, and the Administrator. The Sponsor and Administrator will post the terms and conditions of the amended Official Rules on Competition Website (¡°Corrective Notice¡±). As permitted by law, any amendment will become effective at the time the Sponsor and/or Administrator post the amended Official Rules.?\nF. Excluding Submissions, all intellectual property related to this Competition, including but not limited to trademarks, trade-names, logos, designs, promotional materials, web pages, source codes, drawings, illustrations, slogans and representations are owned or used under license by the Sponsor and/or the Administrator. All rights are reserved. Unauthorized copying or use of any copyrighted material or intellectual property without the express written consent of its owners is strictly prohibited.?\nG. Should any provision of these Official Rules be or become illegal or unenforceable in the jurisdiction of a permitted entrant, such illegality or unenforceability shall leave the remainder of these Official Rules unaffected and valid. The illegal or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid and enforceable provision that comes closest and best reflects the Sponsor¡¯s intention in a legal and enforceable manner with respect to the invalid or unenforceable provision.?\nBy entering, all Contestants (including, in the case of a team, Organization or Large Organization, all participating members) agree to be bound by the Official Rules and hereby release the Released Parties from any and all liability in connection with the Prizes or Contestant¡¯s participation in the Competition. Provided, however, that any liability limitation regarding gross negligence or intentional acts, or events of death or body injury shall not be applicable in jurisdictions where such limitation is not legal.?\nA.
