Any actual; or apparent attempt by any person to undermine the proper conduct of the Competition may be a violation of criminal and civil law.? Should MaRS or Administrator suspect that such an attempt has been made or is threatened, they reserve the right to take appropriate action including but not limited to requiring a Contestant to cooperate with an investigation and referral to criminal and civil law enforcement authorities.\nD. MaRS and/or the Administrator¡¯s failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. The Released Parties are not responsible for incomplete, late, misdirected, damaged, lost, illegible, or incomprehensible Submissions or for address or email address changes of the Contestants. Proof of sending or submitting will not be deemed to be proof of receipt by MaRS or Administrator.

MaRS and Administrator will post the terms and conditions of the amended Official Rules on the Competition Website. ?To the fullest extent permitted by law, any amendment will become effective at the time specified in the posting of the amended Official Rules or, if no time is specified, the time of posting.?\nG.

Should any provision of these Official Rules be or become illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction whose laws or regulations may apply to a Contestant, such illegality or unenforceability shall leave the remainder of these Official Rules, including the Rule affected, to the fullest extent permitted by law, unaffected and valid. The illegal or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid and enforceable provision that comes closest and best reflects the MaRS¡¯ ?intention in a legal and enforceable manner with respect to the invalid or unenforceable provision.\n?\nBy entering, all Contestants (including, in the case of a team or Organization, all participating members) agree to be bound by the Official Rules and hereby release the Released Parties from any and all liability in connection with the Awards or Contestant¡¯s participation in the Competition.
