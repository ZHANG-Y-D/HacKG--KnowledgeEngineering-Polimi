<http://www.semanticweb.org/hezhang/ontologies/2021/6/Hackathon#appsforvehicles> <http://www.semanticweb.org/hezhang/ontologies/2021/6/Hackathon#hackathon-rules> "\nOctober 1st = Vehicle Data Challenge announced at the\nDecember 5th = Challenge officially opens\nJanuary 15th = Deadline for first phase submittals\nFebruary 1st = Phase I Finalist Teams announced\nEarly February = Finalist Teams engage industry leaders to refine ideations and products\nMarch 15th = Deadline for second phase; final product submittals\nApril 1st = Winners announced\nMay = Final cash prizes disbursed\n?\nThe Administration launched the \n in 2012 to liberate data as a fuel for innovation while rigorously protecting privacy.? The primary fuel for the Energy Data Initiative is \n.? Open data can take many forms but generally includes information that is machine-readable, freely accessible and in an industry-standard format.? In particular, open data from the private sector made available to consumers may spur a uniquely scalable degree of innovation.? For example, enabling energy customers to securely access their own household or building energy data 〞 via a ※\n§ on their utility website 〞 has fueled the next generation of energy efficiency products and services.? Within this context, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is launching the \n (the Challenge).? It is worth reiterating that safety 每 such as preventing distracted driving 每 is an essential goal of the Challenge.\nThe Challenge seeks to provide drivers access to their own vehicle＊s data, safely and securely, in a readable, useful common syntax and format.? A full description of the open data from vehicles is in Section V, but generally includes text-based information on things like vehicle speed, brake position, headlights on/off, and distance covered since restart. This vehicle data has long been available to mechanics and technicians using specialized equipment.? But by applying open data principles, individuals will be able to readily access this on-board data directly through Bluetooth, USB, and other standard hardware. Associated platforms will enable vehicle owners to provide this data to authorized third-party developers to create and then deliver new apps, products, and services.? As a result, these third-party developers will help Americans while also creating jobs.\nUnder Federal initiatives like the ※\n§ Grand Challenge and new fuel economy standards, the DOE＊s Vehicles Technology program has a long-term role to play in the acceleration of automotive technology.? Looking to a near-term project that can support this vision, a prize-based Challenge is an effective method to spur innovation with step-jump additions in the availability of new open data.\nThis Challenge prize is a three-part combination of: (1) a cash award; (2) an opportunity to work directly with industry leaders; and (3) an opportunity to be recognized at a public announcement of the final winners.? The Challenge prize will be awarded in phases and component pieces in two phases of competition.? Phase I of the Challenge will cast a wide net to gather compelling ideas, business plans, product development plans, and very-early-stage products (※Ideations§) that address the Challenge＊s goals.? Phase I concludes with a selection of Finalists that will be permitted to continue into Phase II and each Finalist will be awarded a small portion of the total cash pool, ranging from $1000 to $5000.? During Phase II, Finalists will have an opportunity to refine their Ideations with industry leaders supporting the Challenge.? These industry leaders will provide some combination of: technical guidance, customer analysis, market assessments, IT roadmap recommendations, and general consulting.? Following consultation with industry leaders, Finalists will have a period of time to complete and submit their final software applications, web technology, or products (※Products§) for Phase II.? Phase II winner(s) will be invited to a public announcement event hosted by DOE and its supporters and will also be highlighted on DOE＊s web site.? For the purposes of this Challenge, the term Submissions (※Submissions§) refers to the total portfolio of Phase I Ideations and Phase II Products.? The total cash prize pool, inclusive of all cash awards available to be made in Phases I and II, is $50,000.\nThis Challenge is being conducted under the authority of the America COMPETES Act of 2010, 15 U.S.C. ∫ 3719.? The total dollar amount of the prize pool is $50,000.00, subject to the availability of funds.? DOE reserves the right to suspend, cancel, extend, or curtail the Challenge as required or determined by appropriate DOE officials. Nothing within this document or in any documents supporting the Challenge shall be construed as obligating DOE or any other Federal agency or instrumentality to any expenditure of appropriated funds, or any obligation or expenditure of funds in excess of or in advance of available appropriations.? DOE will award a single dollar amount to winning Team(s) and each Team is solely responsible for allocating any prize amount among its member Contestants as they deem appropriate.? DOE will not arbitrate, intervene, advise on, or resolve any matters between entrant members.?? It will be up to the winning Team to reallocate the prize money among its member Contestants, if they deem it appropriate.?\nTo be eligible to compete within this Challenge all of the requirements stated below must be met:\nThere are many electrical and digital systems operating within vehicles.? For this Challenge, the data resources that are to be used by entrants are the datasets that can be directly and legally accessed by vehicle owners on their own cars.? The principal example of this data stream is available through the onboard diagnostics port, also known as OBD-II, which has been mandatory for U.S. cars since 1996.? The OBD-II port contains hundreds of data messages regarding engine and transmission operation as communicated through the vehicle＊s controller area network, which is referred to as the CAN.? The OBD-II port also frequently contains information on operator-adjustable items such as headlight or windshield wiper status. ??Additional hardware is commercially available for individuals to directly access their own vehicles＊ OBD-II data.? However, to remove the need to acquire special hardware for this Challenge and to level the playing field, sample data will be provided by DOE and supporters of the Challenge (※Sample Vehicle Data§).??? The Sample Vehicle Data will contain the following representative types of data fields:\nThe above list of example data streams is not comprehensive and is subject to change. ?Multiple sets of data detailing different driving cycles may be made available.\nThere are additional manufacturer proprietary data fields that also stream through the OBD-II port.? Such proprietary and confidential data 每 such as those that deal with air bags 每 shall not be provided or considered at any point in the Challenge.?\nUse of open vehicle data is mandatory to be considered for a prize in this Challenge.? However, combining the value of this data with other \n 每 such as mashing up/combining the OBD-II with GPS technologies on a smart phone 每 \n.\n\nThe protection of safety and privacy are paramount to both DOE＊s Energy Data Initiative and this Challenge.? Any business plan or product that presents a clear or potential violation of this principle will be rejected by the judges.? Each of the four criteria categories below has equal importance in the evaluation (i.e. 25% weighting for each).\nCommon Criteria for Both Phases\n: Each Submission will be rated on the strength of its potential to help individuals, organizations, and communities make informed decisions to improve their fuel efficiency.\n: Each Submission will be rated for the degree of new thinking it brings to applications for the transportation sector, and the creativity shown in designing for impact.\n: Each Submission must make use of open vehicle data. ?Judges will be looking at both the depth of usage for each data stream and the breadth of different data streams that are integrated.? The combination of the Sample Vehicle Data with other data sets 每 such as those that are universally generated by smart phones 每 is highly encouraged.? You can find other sample datasets at \n.\nSpecial Criteria for Phase I Ideations\n: Each Submission will be rated on the completeness of the Ideation and the evidence 每 such as can be demonstrated by documented/demonstrated experience 每 that the Team＊s proposal can actually be created in the remaining time period of the Challenge.\nSpecial Criteria for Phase II Products\n: Each Submission will be rated on its ability to be immediately used by consumers, such as a vehicle owner being able to download an app onto their smartphone from a website or mobile app platform.? User experience and interactive capabilities will also be assessed. ?Preference will be given to applications/products that are accessible to a range of consumers, including those with disabilities.? Phase II needs to result in real products that can be used; not just illustrations or demonstrations.\nSubmissions will be judged by an expert panel as well as the public.? The expert judging panel will be appointed by DOE, may include both Federal and non-Federal personnel, and will determine Phase I and Phase II winners.? The Popular Choice Product will be determined by public vote on Challenge.gov.? Public votes may be displayed on the Challenge website, on a real-time basis, before being verified for integrity. These unverified votes will not necessarily reflect accurately the voting for the Popular Choice Awards.? The winners of the Popular Choice Awards will be determined on the basis of the verified vote counts, as determined by DOE, and DOE reserves the right to suspend, cancel or extend the Popular Choice Product voting period at any time for any reason.\nThe Administrator＊s computer, within the DOE＊s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, is the official time-keeping device for this Challenge.? The rules for Submissions 每 defined above as referring to both the Phase I Ideations and Phase II Products 每 by Teams are as follows:\n(a) Visit http://AppsforVehicles.challenge.gov and click ※Sign Up§ to create a ChallengePost account, or click ※Log In§ and log in with an existing ChallengePost account.\n(b) Register your interest in participating by clicking ※Accept this Challenge§ on the Challenge Website in order to receive important Challenge updates.
