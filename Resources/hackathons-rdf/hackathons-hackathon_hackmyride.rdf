With an anticipated 2 million more people coming to the Bay Area by 2040, this is only going to get worse. People want more options other than driving. VTA is connecting with Silicon Valley＊s developer community to develop an innovative, intelligent and easy-to-use transportation network that lets us focus on what we enjoy, be more productive, and connect people and ideas.\nVTA seeks to expand Santa Clara County＊s mobility and transportation options by creating walkable, bikeable, and transit-oriented communities, expanding high quality transit service, and addressing congestion in innovate ways. VTA＊s goal is to create technology that will help people shift from single-occupant vehicles to attractive new options. This technology could lead to a better quality of life, economic growth, opportunity, less pollution, and lower greenhouse gas emissions.\nVTA has launched an Open Data Initiative and will be releasing its initial datasets in advance of the Hack My Ride event so they＊ll be available to participants.\nThe Hack My Ride event will focus on?technology that would best address the following priorities:\nA. Increase transit ridership through one or more of the following approaches:\n(i) Easy trip planning tools that help VTA customers get to their destinations conveniently and quickly using a variety of transportation modes\n(ii) ※Gamification§ or reward-based applications that encourage increased transit use\n(iii) Enable VTA to better understand customer needs (origins and destinations, trip times, amenities, information) so we can improve the service\n(iv) Technology that makes transit more accessible to people with disabilities\n(v) Apps that spread the word about VTA＊s transit service, such as through social networks\n(vi) Technology that adds value to existing customers＊ trips to improve retention\n(vii) Apps that take advantage wearable devices and the Internet of Things\n(viii) Apps that connect VTA customers with public art, history, open space, or entertainment\nB. Help VTA build better relations with the communities it touches through listening and feedback, creating mobile or web-based technology that accomplishes one or more of the following:\n(i) Tap the ※wisdom of the crowd§ through micro-tasking or crowdsourcing, such as tools to gather data about travel patterns to help with VTA＊s service planning\n(ii) Creatively educate the community about important transportation and transit topics\n(iii) Create informative, insightful visualizations using VTA Open Data and other datasets\n(iv) Encourage public participation in VTA decision making by making it an easy, positive and rewarding experience\n1.
