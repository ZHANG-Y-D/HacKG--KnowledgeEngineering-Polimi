Participation in the Hackathon constitutes your full and unconditional acceptance of these rules.\nTO REGISTER TO AND PARTICIPATE IN THE HACKATHON, YOU MUST AGREE TO THE RULES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THESE RULES, YOU MAY NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE HACKATHON.\nThe Hackathon will be held on May 1-3, 2015 at the Dealer.com offices in Burlington, VT and aims to find applications that empower people with blink-of-an-eye responsive, sharing-capable, always-on reliable networks -- what we call ¡°gigabit¡± apps (¡°Apps¡±). To do that, we are trying to grow the ecosystem of technologists working to create those applications by bringing together the community at events including this Hackathon.\nAll eligible entries will be assessed based on the criteria described below and three or more winners, at Administrator¡¯s sole discretion, will be chosen according to these criteria. The prizes will be name recognition only, to the exclusion of any monetary or in-kind prizes.\nThe Hackathon is subject to all applicable Federal and state laws and regulations, including but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to privacy and data collection.\nParticipants may enter as a team or individually.\nAdministrator has the right, in its sole discretion, to determine whether a potential Participant is eligible to participate in the Hackathon.\nPARTICIPANT IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING ALL REQUIRED APPROVALS, CONSENTS AND AUTHORIZATIONS, IF ANY, THAT MAY BE REQUIRED PRIOR TO ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE HACKATHON AND SUBMISSION OF AN APP FOR FINAL JUDGING, INCLUDING APPROVALS, CONSENTS AND AUTHORIZATIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED FROM ITS EMPLOYER.\nParticipation in the Hackathon constitutes a Participant's full and unconditional acceptance of these Rules and the Administrator' decisions, which are final and binding in all matters related to the Hackathon.?

How compelling is the story for users?\nThe judges¡¯ winner selection is at their sole and absolute discretion and is final and binding on all participants. The winners will be announced at the closing ceremony at the end of the Hackathon.\nThe judges will award prizes to eligible Apps that best embody Administrator¡¯s vision of applications enabled or enhanced by fast networks.

These Rules contain the entire agreement between Participant and Administrator relating to the Hackathon, and no amendment or modification of these Rules will be valid unless in a writing signed by Administrator.? To the maximum extent permitted by law, Administrator reserves the right to change these Rules at any time. Should any provision of these Rules be held to be void, invalid or inoperative, the remaining provisions will continue in effect and the invalid provision will be deemed modified to the least degree necessary to remedy such invalidity.? In the event that there is an ambiguity, discrepancy or inconsistency between these Rules and any other disclosures or other statements, whether written or oral, contained in any Hackathon-related materials or made at the Hackathon, it will be resolved in the Administrator's sole discretion. ?\nBy participating in the Hackathon, Participant agrees to each of the following:\n1.?? ?to comply with and be bound by these Rules and the decisions of the Administrators and/or the judges, which are binding and final in all matters related to the Hackathon, including interpretation of these Rules and awarding of prizes; and\n2.?? ?to the extent allowed by applicable law, to release and hold harmless the Administrator, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and agents as well as the Mentors (collectively, the \"Released Parties\") from and against any and all losses, damages, costs, expenses, liability, and claims of any kind, including, but not limited to, any injury, death, damage, loss of property, revenue, or profits, negligence, invasion of privacy, defamation, slander, libel, violation of right of publicity, misappropriation of trade secrets, infringement of trademark, copyright or other intellectual property rights, in each case whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising out of or relating to Participant¡¯s creation or submission of an App, participation in the Hackathon (including any travel or activity related thereto), the decision of the judges, acceptance or use or misuse of any prize (including any activity related thereto), and/or the broadcast, transmission, performance, exploitation, or use of Participant¡¯s submission. ?\n3.?? ?to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Administrator, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents from and against any and all claims, expenses, and liabilities (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to (i) a violation of third party intellectual property rights as a result of Participant¡¯s participation in the Hackathon or submission of an App, or (ii) any access or attempt to access Administrator¡¯s information systems or confidential information (including third party confidential information) to which Participant has not been expressly granted access to by Administrator.\nWARRANTY DISCLAIMER\nADMINISTRATOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE HACKATHON, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.?
