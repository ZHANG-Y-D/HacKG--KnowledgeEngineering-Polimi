A PURCHASE OR PAYMENT OF ANY KIND WILL NOT INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF WINNING.\nThe Apps for Science Challenge (the ¡°Challenge¡±) is a skill based competition that challenges participants to develop software applications on the Elsevier SciVerse platform (the ¡°Application¡±). The Challenge is intended to provide recognition to individuals, teams of individuals, corporations and nonprofit organizations (collectively, ¡°Contestants¡±) for developing an Application that utilizes content from the SciVerse product suite: ScienceDirect, Scopus and Hub available at \n, \n and \n respectively. The goal of the Challenge is twofold: (1) to stimulate the development of Applications on the SciVerse platform; and (2) to grow the developer network around the SciVerse platform.\n1. Create a working Application on the SciVerse platform that uses at least one API from the SciVerse Content APIs and SciVerse Framework APIs, as described in the developer documentation on the SciVerse developer portal located at http://developer.sciverse.com.\n 2. Visit AppsForScience.com to create an account and submit a link to your Application, submit a video of your working Application, a short (100 words or less) text description of your Application, and a longer (750 words or less) text description of your Application (collectively, the ¡°Submission¡±).\nSubmissions will be judged on the following three criteria: (1) Quality of the Idea (including creativity and originality); (2) Implementation of the Idea (including user experience and design); and (3) Potential Positive Impact on SciVerse customers.\n*Review the sections below for a more detailed description and important requirements and restrictions.\nThe Challenge is open only to: 1) legal residents of the fifty (50) United States (including the District of Columbia), Australia, Germany, India, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands who have reached the age of majority in their state or country of residence; and 2) corporations or organizations that are domiciled in the United States, Australia, Germany, India, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands incorporated at the time of entry.

Submissions must not be indecent, defamatory, in obvious bad taste, demonstrate a lack of respect for public morals or conduct, or adversely affect the reputation of the Sponsor, as determined in Sponsor¡¯s and/or Administrator¡¯s sole discretion. \n 7. Submissions must not: a) be illegal under applicable laws; b) depict hatred, or defame or threaten a specific community in society, or be capable of inciting violence; c) contain vulgar language or violence; or d) contain pornography, obscenity or sexual activity, as determined in Sponsor¡¯s and/or Administrator¡¯s sole discretion. \n 8. Submission must a) be original; b) be solely owned by Contestant so that no other party has any rights or interest in the Submission, whether known or unknown; and c) not violate the Intellectual Property, common law or privacy rights of other parties. A Contestant may contract with a third party to assist with Submission, provided the Contestant is the sole and unequivocal owner of all intellectual property and licenses in the Submission.\nContestants will continue to own any applicable intellectual property rights in their Submissions, but by entering a Submission, Contestants grant to the Sponsor and Administrator a world-wide royalty free license to, without limitation: a) Post the textual descriptions of the Submissions on AppsForScience.com or any other website owned or affiliated with the Sponsor in perpetuity; and b) Make the Submissions available for use on the SciVerse platform during the course of the Challenge and at least 12 months after the conclusion of the Challenge Submission Period.\nOnce a Contestant enters a Submission, the Submission cannot be modified in any way until after the Judging and Voting periods are complete.\nSubmissions will be posted on AppsForScience.com on a rolling basis after being screened by the Administrator for basic functionality, accuracy of messaging, and integrity (i.e., security). The Administrator has the right to request access to the Application in person or via any reasonable manner to verify that the Application functions and operates as stated in the Submission. Failure by a Contestant to honor such a request will result in immediate disqualification of the Submission. The Administrator also has the right to remove Submissions after posting, if it determines, in its sole discretion, that the Submission is ineligible for the Challenge for any reason. All Contestants will have equal access to Submissions posted on the website. Non-Contestants interested in the Challenge are also encouraged to register and show support for the Challenge at AppsForScience.com. Registration will be required in order to receive updates on the Challenge and vote for the Popular Choice Award.\nBetween August 15, 2011 at 9:00 AM ET and September 12, 2011 at 5:00 PM ET registered users of AppsForScience.com may vote for the Submission/Application that offers the greatest added value to users of the SciVerse suite or solves the best a practical need or limitation in the search and discovery using the SciVerse suite. The Submission/Application with the highest number of votes during this period will win the Popular Choice Award. Each registered user may vote only once for each Submission per day during the voting period. For purposes of this limitation, each day begins at 12:00 a.m. ET and ends at 11:59:59 p.m. ET on each calendar date during the voting period, with the exception of the first day, which begins at 9:00 a.m. ET, and the last day, which ends at 5:00 p.m. ET.\nUse of an automated process or similar device to submit an electronic vote is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to circumvent the one vote per Submission per day limit per registered user or to use an automated vote process will disqualify all votes from that registered user. If a Contestant receives multiple and/or irregular votes from the same user or users, including but not limited to, votes generated by a robotic, programmed, script, macro, other automated means or other source, the Sponsor and/or Administrator reserve the right to disqualify the Contestant in their sole discretion. If the voting process for the Popular Choice Award fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, the Sponsor and/or Administrator in their sole discretion reserve the right to use another means to determine the winner of the Popular Choice Award, i.e. random selection or appointing a panel of judges. Contestants may not pay people or provide any other type of consideration in exchange for votes. Any Contestant who violates the ban on paying or providing consideration in exchange for votes will be disqualified.\nPublic votes may be displayed on the Challenge website, on a real-time basis, before being verified for integrity. These unverified votes do not necessarily reflect accurately the winner of the Popular Choice Award. The winner of the Popular Choice Award will be the entrant(s) who is contacted directly by the Administrator or Sponsor after votes have been verified. Sponsor reserves the right to modify the voting period at any time for any reason.\nSubmissions will initially be screened by a qualified internal panel selected by the Sponsor in its sole discretion. The internal panel will judge the Submissions on the criteria identified below to select a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 25 finalist Submissions. Then the finalist Submissions will be judged by an independent expert judging panel determined by the Sponsor. Sponsor reserves the right to substitute or modify the judging panel at any time for any reason. Judges do have the right to withdrawal without advance notice in the event of extenuating circumstances beyond their control. Judges will be fair and impartial. A judge may elect to recuse himself or herself from judging a Submission, if in the judge¡¯s sole discretion it is not appropriate for him or her to judge that particular Submission because of a past or current relationship with that particular Contestant. A Submission will not be at a disadvantage if one or more judge recuses him or herself. Sponsor reserves the right to award fewer than number of prizes stated below in the event an insufficient number of eligible Submissions are entered or if there is an insufficient number of eligible Submissions entered that meet the judging criteria articulated below in Sponsor¡¯s sole discretion. Because this is a contest of skill, odds of winning depend upon the quality and eligibility of Submissions received and Contestants¡¯ final overall scores, as determined by the judging criteria.\nCriteria \n 1. Quality of the Idea (including creativity and originality)\n 2. Implementation of the Idea (including user experience and design)\n 3. Potential Positive Impact on SciVerse customers and the value to the end-user of the SciVerse product suite\nThe five (5) Contestants, whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores will win the Grand Prize, Second Prize, Third Prize and Honorable Mention prizes identified below in section 7. In the event of a tie at any prize level, the winner will be selected based on the higher score awarded first according to the ¡°quality of the idea¡± criterion, then by the ¡°implementation of the idea¡± criterion, and finally by the ¡°potential positive impact¡± criterion.\nOne (1) winner will be based solely on the eligible votes of registered visitors to AppsForScience.com. If there is a tie between one or more Submissions for the Popular Choice Award, the cash prize will be split equally amongst the tied Contestants.\nALL POTENTIAL CHALLENGE WINNERS ARE SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION BY SPONSOR AND/OR ADMINISTRATOR WHOSE DECISIONS ARE FINAL AND BINDING IN ALL MATTERS RELATED TO THE CHALLENGE AND NO CORRESPONDENCE WILL BE ENTERED INTO. Potential winners must continue to comply with all terms and conditions of these Official Rules. The potential winners will be notified via e-mail on or about October 30, 2011. The potential winners will be required to sign and return to Sponsor, within ten (10) business days of the date notice is sent, an affidavit or for UK entrants a certificate of eligibility, and liability/publicity release (except where prohibited), and for U.S. residents, an IRS Form W9, in order to claim his/her prize. If a potential winner of any prize cannot be contacted, fails to sign and return the claim forms within the required time period, or if the prize or prize notification is returned as undeliverable, potential winner forfeits prize. In the event that a potential winner of a Challenge prize is disqualified for any reason, Sponsor may award the applicable prize to an alternate winner who had the highest score remaining of the eligible entries.\nEach Honorable Mention winner will receive an Apple iPad, 16GB Wi-Fi enabled device, approximate retail value US$499 each. Winners are responsible for all costs and expenses associated with use and maintenance of the Apple iPad.\nFor all Prizes: Winners are responsible for all taxes and fees associated with prize receipt and/or use. Sponsor reserves the right to substitute prizes of comparable value. No transfer or substitution of a prize is permitted except by Sponsor. If a team of individuals, a corporation or an organization is selected as a prize winner, the prize will be awarded to the group and it will be up to the group to split or appropriately allocate the prize. Sponsor and Administrator shall have no liability or responsibility if any dispute should arise among team members regarding a prize. Checks will be sent to the winners via courier within 8-12 weeks following confirmation. Winners that reside in countries outside the United States should bear in mind that negotiation of the check and currency exchange may result in deductions from the prize amount shown above.\nBy entering, each Contestant agrees to: (a) comply with and be bound by these Official Rules and the decisions of the Sponsor, Administrator, and/or the Challenge judges which are binding and final in all matters relating to this Challenge; (b) except where the losses, expenses or liabilities in question arise either from negligence, breach of these Official Rules or other default on the part of any of the Released Parties or from death or personal injury caused by negligence of one or more of the Released Parties (see definition below) release and hold harmless the Sponsor, Administrator, and their respective parent, subsidiary, and affiliated companies, the prize suppliers and any other organizations responsible for sponsoring, fulfilling, administering, advertising or promoting the Challenge, and all of their respective past and present officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the ¡°Released Parties¡±) from and against any and all claims, expenses, and liability, including but not limited to negligence and damages of any kind to persons and property, including but not limited to invasion of privacy (under appropriation, intrusion, public disclosure of private facts, false light in the public eye or other legal theory), defamation, slander, libel, violation of right of publicity, infringement of trademark, copyright or other intellectual property rights, property damage, or death or personal injury arising out of or relating to a Contestant¡¯s entry, creation of an entry or submission of an entry, participation in the Challenge, acceptance or use or misuse of prize and/or the broadcast, transmission, performance, exploitation or use of entry; and (c) indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sponsor and Administrator from and against any and all claims, expenses, and liabilities (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of or relating to a Contestant¡¯s participation in the Challenge and/or Contestant¡¯s acceptance, use or misuse of prize.\nExcept where prohibited by law, participation in the Challenge constitutes consent for Sponsor, Administrator and their agents and affiliates to use winner¡¯s name, likeness, photograph, voice, opinions and/or hometown and state for promotional purposes relating to this Challenge in any media, worldwide, for an unlimited period of time, without limitation and without further payment or consideration.\nSponsor and Administrator reserve the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify the Challenge, or any part of it, if any fraud, technical failures or any other factor beyond Sponsor¡¯s and/or Administrator¡¯s reasonable control impairs the integrity or proper functioning of the Challenge, as determined by Sponsor and/or Administrator in their sole discretion. Sponsor and/or Administrator reserve the right in their sole discretion to disqualify any individual or Contestant it finds to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Challenge or to be acting in violation of these Official Rules or any other promotion or in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the Challenge may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, Sponsor and/or Administrator reserve the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. Sponsor¡¯s and/or Administrator¡¯s failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. Sponsor and Administrator are not responsible for, nor are they required to count, incomplete, late, misdirected, damaged, unlawful or illicit votes, including those secured through payment, votes achieved through automated means or by registering more than one e-mail account and name, using another Contestant¡¯s e-mail account and name, as well as those lost for technical reasons or otherwise.\nThe Released Parties are not responsible for: (1) any incorrect or inaccurate information being provided as a result of factors beyond their reasonable control, whether caused by entrants, printing errors or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the Challenge; (2) technical failures of any kind for which they are not responsible, including, but not limited to malfunctions, interruptions, or disconnections in phone lines or network hardware or software; (3) unauthorized human intervention in any part of the entry process or the Challenge; (4) technical or human error which may occur in the administration of the Challenge or the processing of entries; or (5) any injury or damage to persons or property which may be caused, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from entrant¡¯s participation in the Challenge or receipt or use or misuse of any prize. If for any reason an entrant¡¯s Submission is confirmed to have been erroneously deleted, lost, or otherwise destroyed or corrupted, entrant¡¯s sole remedy is another provide another Submission. No more than the stated number of prizes will be awarded.\nEntrant agrees that: (1) any and all disputes, claims and causes of action arising out of or connected with this Challenge, or any prizes awarded, shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action; (2) any and all disputes, claims and causes of action arising out of or connected with this Challenge, or any prizes awarded, shall be resolved exclusively by the United States District Court or the appropriate New York State Court; (3) any and all claims, judgments and awards shall be limited to actual out-of-pocket costs incurred, including costs associated with entering this Challenge, but in no event attorneys¡¯ fees; and (4) under no circumstances will entrant be permitted to obtain awards for, and entrant hereby waives all rights to claim punitive, incidental and consequential damages and any other damages, other than for actual out-of-pocket expenses, and any and all rights to have damages multiplied or otherwise increased.
