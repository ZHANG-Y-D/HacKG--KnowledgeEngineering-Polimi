For full details and definitions, please see the Codegeist Official Rules below.\nCODEGEIST OFFICIAL RULES\nSPECIAL APPLICATION OF THE RULES FOR TEAMS AND BUSINESS ENTITY CONTESTANTS:\nCOMPETITION ENTRIES: A submission into the Competition by a Contestant, which includes the submitted Add-on or Power-Up and the submission on the Competition Page, must satisfy the following requirements in order to qualify as an ¡°Entry¡± for the Competition:\nJUDGING: After the Competition Entry Deadline, all eligible Entries will be subject to judging in order to determine remainder of the prizes (other than the Entry Prize).\nThe judging criteria are to be applied in the sole discretion of Sponsor and the individual Judges. By entering the Promotion, entrants acknowledge that such evaluations may differ from person to person and agree to be bound by and not challenge the final decisions of Sponsor and the individual Judges. The decision of the Judges is final and binding.\nPRIZES AND CONDITIONS TO AWARDING PRIZES:\nCONTEST PRIZE VALIDATION AGREEMENT: \nAll Contestants who are selected to receive a prize will be required to complete and enter into a Contest Prize Validation Agreement or other documents prior to being identified as a winner or receiving a prize. The Contest Prize Validation Agreement will contain (i) an affidavit as to the requirements for eligibility in the Competition, (ii) a publicity release providing Atlassian the right to use the Contestant¡¯s name or likeness on Atlassian websites, the Competition website hosted by Devpost, and in related media promoting Atlassian, including the Competition, (iii) an indemnification agreement relating to any breach of warranties made by Contestant under these Rules and (iv) such other provisions that may be required to comply with laws applicable to the awarding of the prize, including tax requirements. If a team or Business Entity is selected as a potential prize recipient, all members of the team or a person with the authority to bind the Business Entity, must enter into the Contest Prize Validation Agreement, which will also provide how the prize should be delivered. Failure to comply with this requirement or to submit any of these documents within the time period specified in an email from Atlassian (or Devpost on behalf of Atlassian) providing the Agreement may mean that the Entry will no longer be eligible to win the applicable prize and Atlassian may, in its sole discretion, select an alternative Contestant to receive the prize.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS: As between Atlassian and the Contestant, the Contestant retains ownership of all intellectual property rights in and to the Entry, including the right to offer and distribute the application commercially, except for the license rights granted in these Rules. In order for an application to be eligible as an Entry, each Contestant submitting the application must, and hereby does, grant Atlassian a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, free and non-exclusive license to (i) use, reproduce, publicly perform and publicly display the material that Contestant submits to this Competition for the purposes of allowing Atlassian to use, test and evaluate the Entry for purposes of the Competition, to administer the technical and other requirements of the Competition, and to advertise, display, demonstrate or otherwise promote the Competition, the Atlassian Marketplace and Atlassian. Contestant specifically agrees that Atlassian shall have the right to use, reproduce, publicly perform and publicly display the Entry in connection with the advertising and promotion of the Competition, the Atlassian Marketplace and Atlassian via communication to the public or other groups, including, without limitation, the right to make screenshots, animations and video clips available for promotional purposes. Contestant also hereby grants to the Judges a limited, non-exclusive, free and worldwide license to install, perform, display and use the Entry on any compatible computing device. Contestant may not charge a fee for the download of an Entry by Atlassian or the Judges.\nPUBLICITY RELEASE: Each Contestant hereby grants Atlassian the right to use, publicly display, publish and reproduce, for all purposes, including publicity, promotion and advertising, in any media, online or offline, Contestant¡¯s name, city, state and country of residence, voice, photograph, likeness and image, including any video and other images and audio files submitted by Contestant or obtained by Atlassian, and create, use, publish and reproduce derivative works thereof (collectively, ¡°Publicity Materials¡±). Contestant hereby waives any right Contestant may have to inspect or approve the Publicity Materials, as used in connection with the Competition or any related advertising, and any and all right to receive compensation of any kind on account of such use based on claims of the Contestant as to the rights of privacy, publicity, notoriety or any other rights arising out of or relating to any use by Atlassian of the Contestant¡¯s name, likeness or appearance, or the content of their Entry.\nENTRY INFORMATION;\nPRIVACY AND PUBLICITY.\nWARRANTY AND INDEMNITY: \nEach Contestant, by registering and submitting any Entry, warrants that their Entry information is accurate and that that they are the sole and exclusive owner and/or authorized licensee of all rights in and to the content of their submitted Entry, that no third parties will make any challenges or claims as to ownership or fraud, and that they have the right to submit the Entry in the Competition and grant all required licenses under these Rules. Each Contestant warrants that the Contestant has not submitted any Entry that (1) infringes any third party proprietary rights, intellectual property rights, industrial property rights, personal or moral rights or any other rights including, without limitation, copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret or confidentiality obligations; or (2) otherwise violates applicable U.S. law or the law of the Contestant's country of residence.\nGOVERNING LAW; FORUM AND RECOURSE TO JUDICIAL PROCEDURES: These Rules shall be governed by, subject to and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States of America, excluding all conflict of law rules. If any provision in these Rules is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be modified to the extent legally permissible to most closely implement the intention of such provision and all other provisions hereof will remain in full force and effect. Atlassian reserves the right to modify these Rules at any time prior to completion of the Competition to address any legal or other requirement that may arise in connection with the Competition. Each Contestant who registers for the Competition will receive email notification of any such change in the Rules. To the extent permitted by law, the rights to litigate, seek injunctive relief or make any other recourse to judicial or any other procedure in case of disputes or claims resulting from or in connection with this Competition are hereby excluded, and all Contestants expressly waive any and all such rights.\nWINNER'S LIST: You may request a list of winners after October 30, 2017 by writing to: Atlassian Codegeist, Atlassian Pty Ltd, c/o Atlassian, Inc.,1098 Harrison Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA.\nINTERPRETATIONS OF RULES: Where Atlassian has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the Rules, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Rules will govern your relationship with Atlassian. If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Rules says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence. All time references in these Rules shall be to Pacific Time in the United States.\nINELIGIBLE PERSONS: The Competition is not open to any of the following persons (¡°Ineligible Persons¡±): (1) anyone who is not at least the legal age of majority, at the time of Entry, to form valid contracts in their respective country, province or state of legal residence; (2) anyone who does not satisfy any applicable legal requirements under United States and other applicable jurisdictional legal requirements for participation; or (3) in, a country, state, province or territory where the laws of the United States or local law prohibits participating or receiving a prize in the Hackathon (including, but not limited to, Brazil, Quebec, and Cuba, Sudan, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Myanmar (formerly Burma) and any other country designated by the United States Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control) .

Atlassian and Administrator reserve the right to verify eligibility and to adjudicate on any dispute at any time.\nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY. YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE COMPETITION IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. ATLASSIAN HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPETITION. ATLASSIAN SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR PARTICIPATION OR INABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMPETITION. Atlassian assumes no responsibility for any computer, online, telephone transmission or technical malfunctions that may occur during participation in the Competition, or for theft, destruction or unauthorized access to, or alteration of, your Add-on or Power-Up or any other materials submitted by you. Atlassian is not responsible for any incorrect or inaccurate information, whether caused by website users, Contestants or any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the Competition, or for any technical or human error which may occur in the processing of submissions in the Competition.
