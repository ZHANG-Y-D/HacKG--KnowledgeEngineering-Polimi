Peak demand is defined as the time during the day when demand is highest on the electricity grid, generally 12:00 PM to 6:00 PM on weekdays. This award can be won in addition to another prize category.\nA preliminary panel of judges selected by DOE will initially screen submissions. The preliminary panel will judge the Submissions on the criteria identified above to select finalist Submissions. The Finalist Submissions will be scored by the finalist panel of judges on a scale of 1-10 (ten being the highest) in a range of categories that reflect the above criteria.? The average score in each category will be computed, and the average scores will be combined to compute a total score for every app. The app with the highest total score overall will receive the Best Overall Application Grand Prize, and the app with the highest total score among student developers will receive the Student Award Grand Prize, unless the app with the highest score among student developers would also win the Best Overall App Grand Prize, in which case that app will win the Best Overall Application Grand Prize only, and the second highest total score among the student developers will win the Student Award Grand Prize. The second and third prizes will be awarded in a similar manner, with no app winning more than one Overall or Student Award. For the Peak Energy Usage Award, all that submissions that address peak demand energy usage will be compared. The app with the highest average score across all three criteria will win the award. Judges may be named after commencement of the Competition.?\nA Contestant¡¯s likelihood of winning will depend primarily on the number and quality of all of the Submissions, as determined by the Judges using the criteria below.

The app with the most valid votes will be deemed the Popular Choice Award Grand Prize winner, and the app with the second most votes will be deemed the Popular Choice Award Second Prize winner. An app may win either of the Popular Choice Awards and one of the Best Overall or Student Awards and the Peak Energy Usage Award. If the voting process for the Popular Choice Awards fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, DOE in their sole discretion reserves the right to use another means to determine the winner of the Popular Choice Awards. Contestants may not pay or otherwise compensate anyone or provide any other type of consideration, in exchange for votes.\nPublic votes may be displayed on the competition website, on a real-time basis, before being verified for integrity.
