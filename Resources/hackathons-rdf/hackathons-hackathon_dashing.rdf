Use of a manual or automated process or similar method, or multiple e-mail addresses, to submit more than one vote per Submission is strictly prohibited. ?Any attempt to circumvent the one-vote limit per person per Submission is strictly prohibited and the use of a manual or automated vote processes to do so will subject all votes from the person or entity to disqualification.

In the event a winner/potential winner¡¯s employer has a policy that prohibits the awarding of a Prize to an employee, and applies such policy to a Prize, the Prize will be forfeited and an alternate potential winner will be selected.?\nA. Each Contestant hereby acknowledges and agrees that the relationship between the Contestant and the Sponsor and ChallengePost, is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other special relationship, and that the Contestant¡¯s decision to provide the Contestant¡¯s Submission to Sponsor and ChallengePost for the purposes of this Competition does not place the Sponsor, ChallengePost, and their respective agents in a position that is any different from the position held by the members of the general public with regard to elements of the Contestant¡¯s Submission.? ?\nB.
