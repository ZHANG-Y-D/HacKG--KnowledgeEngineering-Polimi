She had an assignment in Dr. Solomon¡¯s web design class to create a site about an issue or crisis that impacts our community here as well as globally. Although the refugee crisis seems distant, human needs connect all people. her design idea is a campaign that focuses on bringing families together around the globe, so that families with stability can connect to families in need. ?\nThe app that she has in mind is similar to a dating site.

Recently they started a project looking at human-jaguar interactions and the attitudes of local communities towards this top predator. One of their goals is to teach communities more about the jaguars and their prey and to find ways to minimize human-jaguar conflicts that often lead to the killing of jaguars.?You are invited to explore new ways of visualizing and communicating interesting facts about jaguar ecology, the importance of jaguar in the ecosystem, and jaguar threats to local communities in Peru as well as a broader audience in the US. Find creative ways to show local people that the jaguar is an important part of the ecosystem and that the conservation of the species has benefits for everybody. The hope is that better education will lead to more protection of jaguars or at least to less killing. They would like to target a young audience at first, given the technology access and open mind that young people have.\nFor camera trapping:\n?"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string>.
