In the event of a dispute as to any registration, the authorized account holder of the email address used to register will be deemed to be the Contestant. The ¡°authorized account holder¡± is the natural person or legal entity assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Contestants generally and potential winners may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder. Contestants must comply with the terms of use of MTA Data and other intellectual property at \n.

The Administrator has the right to request access to the Application in person or via any reasonable manner to verify the Application functions and operates as stated in the Submission. Failure by a Contestant to honor such a request may result in immediate disqualification of the Submission. The members of the general public, including all Contestants will have equal access to Submissions posted on the website.\nNon-Contestants interested in the Competition may obtain updates on the competition and vote for their favorite Submissions as part of the Popular Choice Awards, by registering as a visitor on MTAAppQuest.com.

Public voting will determine the winner of the Popular Choice Award Grand Prize and Popular Choice Award Second Prize. Each registered visitor is able to place one vote per day for each of their favorite Submissions. Use of an automated process or similar device to submit an electronic vote is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to circumvent the one-vote limit per Submission per day or to use any form of automated vote process will subject all votes from the person to disqualification. The MTA and/or Administrator reserves the right to disqualify any Contestant in their sole discretion, if a Contestant receives multiple and/or irregular votes from the same user or users, or receives votes in a manner that otherwise may indicate automated or non-automated vote manipulation. If the voting process for the Popular Choice Awards fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, the MTA and/or Administrator in their sole discretion reserves the right to use another means to determine the winner of the Popular Choice Awards. Contestants may not pay or otherwise compensate anyone or provide any other type of consideration, in exchange for votes.\nAny Contestant who, in the sole judgment of the MTA and Administrator, violates any prohibition in the rules will be disqualified.\nPublic votes may be displayed on the competition website, on a real-time basis, before being verified for integrity. These unverified votes will not necessarily reflect accurately the voting for the Popular Choice Awards.\nThe winners of the Popular Choice Awards will be determined on the basis of the verified vote counts, as determined by the MTA or Administrator.
