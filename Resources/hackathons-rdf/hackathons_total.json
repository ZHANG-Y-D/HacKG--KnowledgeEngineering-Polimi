We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any hackathon venue, including hacks, talks, workshops, parties, social media and other online media. Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon without a refund (if applicable) at the discretion of the hackathon organisers.\nThe Less Quick Version\nHarassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.\nPhotography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).\nParticipants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.\nAs this is a hackathon, we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our hackathon are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.\nSponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.\nIf you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of hackathon staff immediately.\nHackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.\nIf a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organisers may take any action they deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the hackathon with no refund (if applicable), or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.\nWe expect participants to follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues and hackathon-related social events.", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "Each team member of the winning team per category will receive a $100 Amazon Gift Card", "prize-title": "Gift cards!"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=Excel London, London E16 1XL, UK", "hackathon-url": "https://ac-nativescript-hackathon.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": ""}], "hackathon-location-address": "Excel London, London E16 1XL, UK", "hackathon-description-header": "Build a NativeScript app using Angular 2 in one of four categories for prizes!", "hackathon-prizes-total": "$100", "hackathon-location-description": "Angular Connect Conference", "hackathon-end-date": "", "has-projects": "False"},

In order to receive a Prize, the potential winner will be required to sign and return to the Administrator, affidavit(s) of eligibility or a similar verification document and liability/publicity release(s) within seven (10) business days (if a potential winner is a team, Organization, or Large Organization, the Representative and all participating members must sign and return to the Administrator said affidavit(s) of eligibility or a similar verification document and liability/publicity release(s) within ten (10) business days). If a winner is considered to be a minor is his or her state of residence, at Sponsor\u2019s sole option, the prize will either be awarded to the minor winner\u2019s parent or legal guardian on behalf of the winner, or the minor\u2019s parent or guardian will be required to ratify and sign the affidavit of eligibility, and liability/publicity release.\u00a0\nB. At the sole discretion of the Sponsor and Administrator, a potential winner will be deemed ineligible to win if:\u00a0\n(i) the potential winner (or in the case of a team, Organization, or Large Organization, their Representative) cannot be contacted within seven (7) business days, or is contacted and refuses the Prize;\u00a0\u00a0\n(ii) the potential winner (or in the case of a team, Organization, or Large Organization, their Representative or any participating member) fail(s) to sign and return the affidavit(s) of eligibility or a similar verification document and liability/publicity release(s) within seven (10) business days from receipt of such documents;\u00a0\u00a0\n(iii) the Prize or Prize notification is returned as undeliverable; or\u00a0\u00a0\n(iv) the Submission or the potential winner, or any member of a potential winner\u2019s team, Organization, or Large Organization, is disqualified for any other reason.\u00a0 In the event of such disqualification, Sponsor and Administrator at their sole discretion may award the applicable Prize to an alternate potential winner. The disqualification of one (or more) team members (or, in the case of Organizations or Large Organizations, any participating members) from further consideration in this Competition for any reason may result in the disqualification of the entire team, Organization, or Large Organization and of each participating member at the sole discretion of the Sponsor and/or Administrator.\n\u00a0\nA. No Prize substitutions will be made except for the right of the Sponsor to make a Prize substitution of equivalent or greater value. Prizes must be accepted as awarded. No transfer or substitution of a Prize is permitted except at the Sponsor\u2019s and Administrator\u2019s sole discretion. The Prize will be mailed to the winning Contestant\u2019s or, if a team or Organization is selected as a prize winner, the Representative\u2019s address within 45 days of receipt of the signed affidavit(s) of eligibility or a similar verification document and liability/publicity release(s) form(s). If a team or an Organization is selected as a Prize-winner, the associated Prize will be shipped to said team or Organization\u2019s Representative.

It is the sole responsibility of Prize winners of US$600 or more to provide certain information to facilitate receipt of the award, including completing and submitting any tax forms when necessary and any applicable withholding and reporting requirements. The Sponsor and Administrator reserve the right to withhold a portion of the prize amount to comply with tax laws.\u00a0\nC.

Proof of sending or submitting will not be deemed to be proof of receipt by Sponsor or Administrator. The Sponsor and the Administrator are not responsible for, nor are they required to count any vote which, in their sole judgment, is incomplete, late, misdirected, damaged, unlawful or illicit, including those secured through payment, votes achieved through automated means, as well as those lost for technical reasons, defective or otherwise in violation of these rules.\u00a0\nD.

Presentations in this\u00a0hackathon should not use\u00a0sexualized images. Apps should not\u00a0intimidate a particular social group.\u00a0We do not tolerate harassment\u00a0in any form.\n\nParticipants asked to stop any behavior are expected to comply immediately.\u00a0Participants violating these rules may be expelled from the hackathon at the discretion of the organizers.\u00a0\nWe're here to help create a collaborative environment where everyone can enjoy the apps and presentations.\nYep! We'll communicate with you through email when you get the ticket. We'll stream the opening ceremony and the presentations live via Google Hangout on Air -- on YouTube.\nWe'll also use a Google Hangout to present across the globe. The only catch is that you would have to be ready to present at the time of the event in San Francisco, 6pm PST, June\u00a013.\nJust snag a \n.\nSome hackathons have big flashy grand prizes. That's not our style. There's no better way to challenge yourself than attending a hackathon. You'll meet great people and get to push yourself.\nThat said we wanted to come up with prizes that can reward the good hacks. First/second/third is not the best way to judge a hackathon because oftentimes hacks are good for different reasons. So we award equal prizes to three judges' choice teams and one audience favorite.\nThe prizes this go around are Apple gift cards in the amount of the price for an Apple Watch Sport Band for each participant on a winning team.\nTeams must be between 1-4 people.\nLike we said, we've got prizes and judges, but they aren't the point of what we're achieving here.\u00a0We're living on the edge and we can define the future.\n\nYou will have 30 seconds to pitch your idea at the start of the day. This is your chance to tell us what you want to work on and what roles you need to fill on your team.\nSince 200 participants will be competing for glory, presentations will happen in two rounds. In the preliminary round at 6pm, each team will present to a pair of judges in a private room. The judges will pick their favorite teams to move on to the finals. Then at 7pm the finalists will present to the entire audience. Presentations are 2-minutes each and should be demos either on a real watch or in the simulator on the computer. No slides.\nOur first round presentations will then be on Saturday evening. We\u2019ll get ready for these at 5:30pm. You will see teams present back-to-back in a private room. You will select one team to move on to the finals.\nThe judges will be evaluating:\nThe finalist teams will then present in front of the whole audience. Prizes will be equal for all winners. There will be an audience favorite as well, chosen at the end.\n: We hold ourselves to a high standard. That means you cannot bring personal code that you've worked on previously into the hackathon.\n: Of course you can do whatever you want at a hackathon if you don't care about the judging process.\u00a0 If you do care, then the code you bring in must be available to everyone at the hackathon prior to the start of the hackathon.\u00a0 To use code you have previously written, contact uswith a link to the code and its license (which must allow others to use it) and we will update the FAQ to notify all participants of the code's availability.\u00a0 Judges will take into account the use of code that has only been made available to participants very recently.\u00a0 To get the highest judge's score for your project you will have to write all of your code at the hackathon and only use generally available libraries that were not created specifically for your hackathon project.\u00a0 Being able to say \"All the code of the demo was written during the hackathon\" enables the highest scoring.\nOne method of achieving the highest score for your demo is to create your demonstration prior to the hackathon (or at least fight through most of the bugs and issues prior to the hackathon) and then leave all of that code at home so that the demo is (re)created from scratch during the hackathon and no old code you previously wrote is accessed during the hackathon.\u00a0 The demonstration must not have previously been made public so that its disclosure at the hackathon is the first public disclosure of the hack.\u00a0 By leaving the code at home or copied externally and deleted locally, you are protected from accusations that copying was performed during the hackathon. Copying code by retyping has no scoring benefit beyond that of copy/pasting code so the rules of general availability of the code, and announcement of your use of it, apply to all retyped code.\nWe're looking forward to seeing what can be built in such a short time. We'll do our best to publicize open source libraries that can help.\nIf you've been to big meetups in the Bay Area, you know that an attendee/RSVP ratio of <50% is quite common. Since we have room for 200 people, that means that we would have to allow over 400 RSVPs to account for all the people who don't show up the day of the event. And then if all those 400 people do show up, we're toast.\nBy charging for tickets we ensure that we all have skin in the game and we can keep the attendee/RSVP ratio more predictable. Also, after all, you will be getting good, healthy, quality food, snacks, and beer. Catering costs big money at this scale.\n\u00a0and show us some love :)", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "There will be three equal winners declared by the judges.

Knight Foundation (\u201cKnight Foundation\u201d) and the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d). \u00a0The goals of the Challenge are to: make local public information more personalized, usable, and accessible for all Americans; promote broadband adoption, particularly among Americans who are less likely to be regular Internet users (including low-income, rural, residents on Tribal lands, seniors, people with disabilities, and the low digital/English literacy communities); and create better links between Americans and services provided by local, state, Tribal and federal governments.\u00a0 The Challenge is intended to bring together providers of public data, developers, and traditionally underserved populations through a national contest for innovative uses of local data, and to provide recognition to contestants who develop software applications (apps) that provide easy access to relevant content with an emphasis on apps that use hyper-local and other public data from cities, counties, townships, Tribes and states.\nThe FCC seeks to promote broadband deployment and adoption for all Americans -- regardless of geography, race, economic status, disability, residence on Tribal land, or degree of digital or English literacy -- by providing easy access to relevant content.\u00a0 New applications can pull new users online, as well as increase the value of broadband connections for existing users. \u00a0Together, increased broadband adoption and deployment can be indispensable for unleashing innovation and investment, spurring job creation and economic growth, and ensuring our country's global competitiveness.\nConsistent with Knight Foundation\u2019s mission to foster informed and engaged communities and the FCC\u2019s goal to encourage broadband adoption and deployment, the FCC and Knight Foundation are co-sponsoring this Challenge, offering $100,000 in prizes.\u00a0 The Knight Foundation is the Challenge Administrator and has contracted with Clay Johnson and Fission Strategy to conduct this Challenge.

The preliminary panel will judge the Submissions on the criteria identified above to select finalist Submissions. The Finalist Submissions will be scored by the finalist panel of judges on a scale of 1-10 (ten being the highest) in a range of categories that reflect the above criteria.\u00a0 The average score in each category will be computed, and the average scores will be combined to compute a total score for every app. The app with the highest total score overall will receive the Best Overall Application Grand Prize, and the app with the highest total score among student developers will receive the Student Award Grand Prize, unless the app with the highest score among student developers would also win the Best Overall App Grand Prize, in which case that app will win the Best Overall Application Grand Prize only, and the second highest total score among the student developers will win the Student Award Grand Prize. The second and third prizes will be awarded in a similar manner, with no app winning more than one Overall or Student Award. For the Peak Energy Usage Award, all that submissions that address peak demand energy usage will be compared. The app with the highest average score across all three criteria will win the award. Judges may be named after commencement of the Competition.\u00a0\nA Contestant\u2019s likelihood of winning will depend primarily on the number and quality of all of the Submissions, as determined by the Judges using the criteria below. The approximate dates for the judging panel are between May 15, 2012 at 8:00 PM ET and May 21, 2012 at 5:00 PM ET.\n\u00a0The public will have the opportunity to select a Popular Choice Award winner, which will be determined by public vote on the \n website during the Public Voting Period (May 17 2012 at 8:00am ET to May 31, 2012 at 8:00pm ET Update: Public voting period extended to May 31.).\u00a0 Each registered visitor will be limited to one vote per day for each of their favorite submissions.\u00a0Any attempt to circumvent the one-vote limit per Submission per day or to use any form of automated vote process will subject all votes from the person to disqualification. \u00a0DOE may disqualify the votes and/or submissions of any users or Contestants seeking to defraud the voting process.\u00a0 The app with the most valid votes will be deemed the Popular Choice Award Grand Prize winner, and the app with the second most votes will be deemed the Popular Choice Award Second Prize winner. An app may win either of the Popular Choice Awards and one of the Best Overall or Student Awards and the Peak Energy Usage Award. If the voting process for the Popular Choice Awards fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, DOE in their sole discretion reserves the right to use another means to determine the winner of the Popular Choice Awards.

This vehicle data has long been available to mechanics and technicians using specialized equipment.\u00a0 But by applying open data principles, individuals will be able to readily access this on-board data directly through Bluetooth, USB, and other standard hardware. Associated platforms will enable vehicle owners to provide this data to authorized third-party developers to create and then deliver new apps, products, and services.\u00a0 As a result, these third-party developers will help Americans while also creating jobs.\nUnder Federal initiatives like the \u201c\n\u201d Grand Challenge and new fuel economy standards, the DOE\u2019s Vehicles Technology program has a long-term role to play in the acceleration of automotive technology.\u00a0 Looking to a near-term project that can support this vision, a prize-based Challenge is an effective method to spur innovation with step-jump additions in the availability of new open data.\nThis Challenge prize is a three-part combination of: (1) a cash award; (2) an opportunity to work directly with industry leaders; and (3) an opportunity to be recognized at a public announcement of the final winners.\u00a0 The Challenge prize will be awarded in phases and component pieces in two phases of competition.\u00a0 Phase I of the Challenge will cast a wide net to gather compelling ideas, business plans, product development plans, and very-early-stage products (\u201cIdeations\u201d) that address the Challenge\u2019s goals.\u00a0 Phase I concludes with a selection of Finalists that will be permitted to continue into Phase II and each Finalist will be awarded a small portion of the total cash pool, ranging from $1000 to $5000.\u00a0 During Phase II, Finalists will have an opportunity to refine their Ideations with industry leaders supporting the Challenge.\u00a0 These industry leaders will provide some combination of: technical guidance, customer analysis, market assessments, IT roadmap recommendations, and general consulting.\u00a0 Following consultation with industry leaders, Finalists will have a period of time to complete and submit their final software applications, web technology, or products (\u201cProducts\u201d) for Phase II.\u00a0 Phase II winner(s) will be invited to a public announcement event hosted by DOE and its supporters and will also be highlighted on DOE\u2019s web site.\u00a0 For the purposes of this Challenge, the term Submissions (\u201cSubmissions\u201d) refers to the total portfolio of Phase I Ideations and Phase II Products.\u00a0 The total cash prize pool, inclusive of all cash awards available to be made in Phases I and II, is $50,000.\nThis Challenge is being conducted under the authority of the America COMPETES Act of 2010, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 3719.\u00a0 The total dollar amount of the prize pool is $50,000.00, subject to the availability of funds.\u00a0 DOE reserves the right to suspend, cancel, extend, or curtail the Challenge as required or determined by appropriate DOE officials. Nothing within this document or in any documents supporting the Challenge shall be construed as obligating DOE or any other Federal agency or instrumentality to any expenditure of appropriated funds, or any obligation or expenditure of funds in excess of or in advance of available appropriations.\u00a0 DOE will award a single dollar amount to winning Team(s) and each Team is solely responsible for allocating any prize amount among its member Contestants as they deem appropriate.\u00a0 DOE will not arbitrate, intervene, advise on, or resolve any matters between entrant members.\u00a0\u00a0 It will be up to the winning Team to reallocate the prize money among its member Contestants, if they deem it appropriate.\u00a0\nTo be eligible to compete within this Challenge all of the requirements stated below must be met:\nThere are many electrical and digital systems operating within vehicles.\u00a0 For this Challenge, the data resources that are to be used by entrants are the datasets that can be directly and legally accessed by vehicle owners on their own cars.\u00a0 The principal example of this data stream is available through the onboard diagnostics port, also known as OBD-II, which has been mandatory for U.S. cars since 1996.\u00a0 The OBD-II port contains hundreds of data messages regarding engine and transmission operation as communicated through the vehicle\u2019s controller area network, which is referred to as the CAN.\u00a0 The OBD-II port also frequently contains information on operator-adjustable items such as headlight or windshield wiper status. \u00a0\u00a0Additional hardware is commercially available for individuals to directly access their own vehicles\u2019 OBD-II data.\u00a0 However, to remove the need to acquire special hardware for this Challenge and to level the playing field, sample data will be provided by DOE and supporters of the Challenge (\u201cSample Vehicle Data\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Sample Vehicle Data will contain the following representative types of data fields:\nThe above list of example data streams is not comprehensive and is subject to change. \u00a0Multiple sets of data detailing different driving cycles may be made available.\nThere are additional manufacturer proprietary data fields that also stream through the OBD-II port.\u00a0 Such proprietary and confidential data \u2013 such as those that deal with air bags \u2013 shall not be provided or considered at any point in the Challenge.\u00a0\nUse of open vehicle data is mandatory to be considered for a prize in this Challenge.\u00a0 However, combining the value of this data with other \n \u2013 such as mashing up/combining the OBD-II with GPS technologies on a smart phone \u2013 \n.\n\nThe protection of safety and privacy are paramount to both DOE\u2019s Energy Data Initiative and this Challenge.\u00a0 Any business plan or product that presents a clear or potential violation of this principle will be rejected by the judges.\u00a0 Each of the four criteria categories below has equal importance in the evaluation (i.e. 25% weighting for each).\nCommon Criteria for Both Phases\n: Each Submission will be rated on the strength of its potential to help individuals, organizations, and communities make informed decisions to improve their fuel efficiency.\n: Each Submission will be rated for the degree of new thinking it brings to applications for the transportation sector, and the creativity shown in designing for impact.\n: Each Submission must make use of open vehicle data. \u00a0Judges will be looking at both the depth of usage for each data stream and the breadth of different data streams that are integrated.\u00a0 The combination of the Sample Vehicle Data with other data sets \u2013 such as those that are universally generated by smart phones \u2013 is highly encouraged.\u00a0 You can find other sample datasets at \n.\nSpecial Criteria for Phase I Ideations\n: Each Submission will be rated on the completeness of the Ideation and the evidence \u2013 such as can be demonstrated by documented/demonstrated experience \u2013 that the Team\u2019s proposal can actually be created in the remaining time period of the Challenge.\nSpecial Criteria for Phase II Products\n: Each Submission will be rated on its ability to be immediately used by consumers, such as a vehicle owner being able to download an app onto their smartphone from a website or mobile app platform.\u00a0 User experience and interactive capabilities will also be assessed. \u00a0Preference will be given to applications/products that are accessible to a range of consumers, including those with disabilities.\u00a0 Phase II needs to result in real products that can be used; not just illustrations or demonstrations.\nSubmissions will be judged by an expert panel as well as the public.\u00a0 The expert judging panel will be appointed by DOE, may include both Federal and non-Federal personnel, and will determine Phase I and Phase II winners.\u00a0 The Popular Choice Product will be determined by public vote on Challenge.gov.\u00a0 Public votes may be displayed on the Challenge website, on a real-time basis, before being verified for integrity. These unverified votes will not necessarily reflect accurately the voting for the Popular Choice Awards.\u00a0 The winners of the Popular Choice Awards will be determined on the basis of the verified vote counts, as determined by DOE, and DOE reserves the right to suspend, cancel or extend the Popular Choice Product voting period at any time for any reason.\nThe Administrator\u2019s computer, within the DOE\u2019s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, is the official time-keeping device for this Challenge.\u00a0 The rules for Submissions \u2013 defined above as referring to both the Phase I Ideations and Phase II Products \u2013 by Teams are as follows:\n(a) Visit http://AppsforVehicles.challenge.gov and click \u201cSign Up\u201d to create a ChallengePost account, or click \u201cLog In\u201d and log in with an existing ChallengePost account.\n(b) Register your interest in participating by clicking \u201cAccept this Challenge\u201d on the Challenge Website in order to receive important Challenge updates.

Further rules changes may occur throughout the weekend in response to questions and emerging issues. Such changes will be announced if and when they occur. The following rules have been set at this time: Teams may have a maximum size of 8 members, excluding mentors and roving participants that assist multiple teams such as voice actors, composers, and other specialists. Teams may use content from third-party sources such as the asset store provided that the judges are provided with all details of this use during judging. Teams may use content from their own prior existing projects provided that they clear this use with the event organizers. This is to ensure that all teams have access to a similar pool of resources. Teams must register using the forms provided on Saturday evening in order to be eligible for prizes. Projects must be produced on-site at the hackathon. The organizers will make exceptions to this rule for teams that require other environments, for example, for filming a 360 scene outdoors. Announcements will be made using the event's Slack channel. Though attempts will be made to inform teams of any announcements in person, this is not guaranteed. It is the responsibility of each team to monitor the Slack channel for any important information. In a change from previous events, we will allocate work spaces to teams on Friday night. Teams will no longer be able to claim spaces in a free-for-all as they have previously. We will be looking into pipe & drape dividers to help divide the main room and prevent interference between equipment. Code of Conduct We, the AR/VR Hackathon Latvia Organizers, are committed to making the VR Hackathon a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or technical expertise (or lack of any of the aforementioned). We will not tolerate harassment of any kind. Harassment may include verbal abuse, sexually explicit or derogatory language, offensive or sexual cartoons or materials, mimicry, offensive gestures, unwelcome sexual advances, and telling of jokes offensive to others in the community. In general, sexual advances of any kind are considered unwelcome by default and are not appropriate at this event. Drugs and alcohol are not permitted on site. Individuals who appear intoxicated or otherwise under the influence of drugs or alcohol will be asked to leave the event until they have recovered. If, in the eyes of the Organizers, a hackathon participant is seen to have violated these rules, they may be warned, sanctioned, or asked to leave the hackathon without a refund (if applicable). In other words, just do the following: be aware of your actions and their effects on others; don\u2019t treat the hackathon like a dating sim; and, in general, be nice to one another.\n\u00a0", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Special prize from Accenture"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=3 T\u0113rbatas iela, Valmiera, Latvia", "hackathon-url": "https://arvrhackathonlv.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": ""}], "hackathon-location-address": "3 T\u0113rbatas iela, Valmiera, Latvia", "hackathon-description-header": "AR Hackathon with Trond Nilsen is event for people interested in augmented and virtual reality technology, who wishes to experiment and execute their idea using these technologies.", "hackathon-prizes-total": "$500", "hackathon-location-description": "Vidzeme University of Applied Sciences - Riga, Latvia", "hackathon-end-date": "", "has-projects": "False"},

Some examples of this would be:\u00a0public domain images, creative commons music, open source libraries.\u00a0We take this rule very seriously for the sake of all members attending the event. Failure to comply may result in the offending team's disqualification.\nIf your team qualifies for prizes or is in the top five, the team will be subject to a code review to verify that there was no foul play.\n\nThe exception to the above rule is that you are encouraged to use 3rd party services, APIs, open source projects, libraries, and frameworks.

Keep this in mind when choosing a location to work, and mention to the organizers that your content is explicit if you\u2019d like to submit for judging.

Failure by a Contestant to respond or honor such a request may result in disqualification of the Submission.\u00a0\u00a0\nB. Posting of a Submission to the Competition Website does not constitute a final determination by the Sponsor that the Submission met requirements. Accordingly a Submission may still be disqualified even after it has been publically displayed.\u00a0\nA. All eligible Submissions will be judged by a panel of impartial judges (the \u201cJudges\u201d) selected by the Sponsor. Eligible Submissions may initially be screened by a qualified internal panel selected by the Sponsor at its sole discretion. The internal panel will judge these Submissions on the criteria identified in these Official Rules to select finalist Submissions. Finalist Submissions may then be judged by the judging panel determined by the Sponsor and identified on the Competition Website. The Sponsor reserves the right to substitute or modify the judging panel at any time for any reason.\u00a0\nB. All Judges shall be and remain fair and impartial. Any Judge may recuse him or herself from judging a Submission if the Judge or the Sponsor considers that it is inappropriate, for any reason, for the Judge to evaluate a specific Submission or group of Submissions.\u00a0\nC. A Contestant\u2019s likelihood of winning will depend primarily on the number and quality of all of the Submissions, as determined by the Judges using the criteria in these Official Rules. The dates for the judging panel are July 17, 2013 at 10:00am Eastern Time and July 31, 2013 at 5:00pm Eastern Time (the \u201cJudging Period\u201d).\u00a0\nA.

The two (2) Contestants whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores will become potential winners of the Prizes identified below in Section 13.\u00a0\nC. Tie Breakers. In the event of a tie between two or more Submissions, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first criterion listed above shall be deemed the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated by comparing the tied Submissions\u2019 scores on the second, third, fourth, and fifth criterion listed above, respectively. If two or more Submissions are tied on all three criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied submissions (the \u201cTie-Breaker Criteria\u201d).\nA. The public voting is scheduled to take place between July 17, 2013 at 10:00am Eastern Time, USA and July 31, 2013 at 5:00pm Eastern Time, USA (the \u201cVoting Period\u201d). Public voting will determine the potential winner of the Popular Choice Award.\nB. The potential winners of the Popular Choice Award will be determined on the basis of the verified vote counts, as determined by the Sponsor. The Sponsor reserves the right to extend the Voting Period at any time for any reason.\nC. One (1) potential winners of the Popular Choice Award prize (described in Section 13 below) will be selected based solely on the highest number of votes received from Registered Visitors on the Competition Website.\u00a0 If there is a tie between or among two or more Submissions for the Popular Choice Award, the higher scoring Submission will be determined by the Judges scores on the criteria described in Section 10(a) above.\nD. The likelihood of being selected to win the Popular Choice Award depends on the total number of verified votes received on the Submissions relative to other Contestants.\nE. Use of an automated process or similar device to submit an electronic vote is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to circumvent the one-vote limit per Submission, including the use of multiple email addresses or any form of automated vote processes will subject all votes from the person or entity to disqualification. The Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any Contestant at their sole discretion, if a Contestant receives multiple and/or irregular votes from the same user or users, or receives votes in a manner that otherwise may indicate automated or non-automated vote manipulation. If the voting process for the Popular Choice Award fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, the Sponsor at their sole discretion reserves the right to determine the winner by using non-suspect votes, or by any other means the Sponsor deems appropriate.\u00a0 If no alternative means of determining a winner of the Popular Choice Award is available, the Sponsor may eliminate the Popular Choice Award. Contestants may not pay or otherwise compensate anyone or provide any other type of consideration in exchange for votes.\nA.

If a winner is considered to be a minor is his or her jurisdiction of residence, at Sponsor\u2019s sole option, the prize will either be awarded to the minor winner\u2019s parent or legal guardian on behalf of the winner, or the minor\u2019s parent or guardian will be required to ratify and sign the affidavit of eligibility, and liability/publicity release.\u00a0\nB. At the sole discretion of the Sponsor, a potential winner will be deemed ineligible to win if:\u00a0\n(i) the potential winner (or in the case of a team, their Representative) cannot be contacted within ten (10) business days, or is contacted and refuses the Prize;\u00a0\u00a0\n(ii) the potential winner (or in the case of a team, their Representative or any participating member) fail(s) to sign and return the affidavit(s) of eligibility or a similar verification document and liability/publicity release(s) within ten (10) business days from receipt of such documents;\u00a0\u00a0\n(iii) the Prize or Prize notification is returned as undeliverable; or\u00a0\u00a0\n(iv) the Submission or the potential winner, or any member of a potential winner\u2019s team, is disqualified for any other reason.\u00a0 In the event of such disqualification, Sponsor at their sole discretion may award the applicable Prize to an alternate potential winner.
