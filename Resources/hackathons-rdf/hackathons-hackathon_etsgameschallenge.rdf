Applications may be final (ready for market or in market) or near final (in need of some additional levels or improved graphics, but fully functioning).? Applications should be aimed at assessing student knowledge/understanding of one of the following topics, as described in the provided Learning Progression document:\n(1) Variables and Equality (approximately grades 5-9)\n(2) Linear Functions (approximately grades 7-10)\n(3) Open Mathematics topic ¨C must include a rubric or learning progression that has a basis in educational or psychological research (see the provided progressions for Variables and Equality and Linear Functions as examples).? Any set of k-12 grade-levels is welcomed;\n(d) A brief written description or video describing how the project distinguishes between levels of the Learning Progression (guiding template is provided but optional).\nEach part of a Submission should be uploaded to the Site during the Entry Period, and each Submission should comply with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
