These challenges are part of an initiative to encourage broad participation in the development and application of legislative data standards and to engage new communities in the use of legislative data.? Goals of this initiative include:\n? ? Enabling wider accessibility and more efficient exchange of the legislative data of the United States Congress; \n??? Encouraging the development of open standards that facilitate better integration, analysis, and interpretation of legislative data; and,\n??? Fostering the use of open source licensing for implementing legislative data standards. \nThe Library of Congress Legislative Data Challenges will recognize individuals, teams of individuals, for-profit legal entities, and/or non-profit organizations for developing proposed solutions or proofs of concepts for the exchange and mapping of legislative information. ?\nThe Markup of U.S. Legislation in Akoma Ntoso Challenge will assess the suitability of the Akoma Ntoso XML schemas for representing the bills of the U.S. Congress and will identify potential modifications to the XML schemas to improve the support U.S. Congressional bill data.?
