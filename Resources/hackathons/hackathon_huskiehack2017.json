You don\u2019t have to be a programmer and you certainly don\u2019t have to be majoring in Computer Science. Hacks provide a venue to think out of the box, experiment with new technologies, ask questions, make mistakes, learn something new, and have fun. \u00a0\n\nThe Huskie Hack is open to ALL majors and disciplines.\u00a0A health and wellness Hackathon opens the door to those interested in the physical, mental, emotional and environmental aspects of health. \u00a0How does health or wellness impact a community? \u00a0What are the economic, political, sociocultural aspects of the health problem you are addressing? \u00a0This event is interdisciplinary. \u00a0Individuals with interest in health, big data, medicine, physical therapy, community development, social work, psychology, sociology, \u00a0biology, art, and engineering are all encouraged to attend.\u00a0\n\nYes.\u00a0The Huskie Hack\u00a0is not just about coding.\u00a0It is about creating, utilizing skill sets you have as an artist, coder, maker, developer, project manager, historian, scientist, etc. \u00a0No expertise is required.\u00a0While having a programming class or two will be helpful, it is not necessary.\u00a0This event is about visualizing the idea, being enthusiastic about making it work, collaborating with the team\u00a0and using the tools to help realize your repurposed, reimagined idea.\u00a0Everyone will be learning, trying\u00a0and doing. Graphic and artistic design, media, and team building skills will also be key to creating an awesome game.\u00a0Want to play with wearable technology?\u00a0 The Oculus Rift?\u00a0 See a 3-D printer in action?\u00a0 This is the time to experiment and have fun.\n\nUnbelievably, it doesn\u2019t cost you anything.\u00a0Zilch.\u00a0We will provide meals, drinks, and snacks for the entirety of the event. Registration is required.\u00a0\n\nMeet and work with awesome people from around the region,\u00a0build cool stuff to put on your portfolio and/or resume,\u00a0network with tech firms, and enjoy\u00a0free food, free swag, free fun!\u00a0\n\nYes! \u00a0Please share the event with other students and teachers because\u00a0we\u2019ve found many offer extra credit for classes going as a group! If you are under 18, we do require your parent or guardian\u2019s permission to attend and will contact you if you are accepted for more details.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBring your laptop, phone, chargers, and any other electronics you can\u2019t live without.\u00a0Feel free to bring a sleeping bag if you want to catch some\u00a0zzz's, and, of course, your enthusiasm to address issues of health and wellness. \u00a0Remember, a\u00a0valid student ID is required.\n\nPlan to arrive at the Hackathon Saturday morning, November 4, 2017, at\u00a011:00 AM, when registration opens.\u00a0Have that student ID and ticket handy.\u00a0The event ends somewhere around 2:00 PM on Sunday, November\u00a05th after the awards are distributed.\n\nThe event will be held at the center of NIU's camps in the Holmes Student Center.\u00a0\u00a0Attendees are responsible for arranging their own transportation. \u00a0 Parking on campus is free.\u00a0", "hackathon-number-of-participants": "128", "hackathon-is-colocated": "True", "hackathon-has-ended": "True", "hackathon-number-of-judging-criteria": "1", "hackathon-requirements": "\nAll submissions must be uploaded to DEVPost by 6:00 AM on Sunday, November 5, 2017.\n\n", "hackathon-rules": "\nYou don't need to have a team to participate, but the creative process of a Hackathon lends itself to team and team building. The Huskie Hack is about collaborating and integrating\u00a0individual skill sets, experiences, and creative problem solving taken into account when addressing an issue or problem. In other words, you don\u2019t need one, but teams are\u00a0encouraged. We will assist in grouping teams together during the event, so don\u2019t let this discourage you from attending!\u00a0An\u00a0ideal team often includes a coder, an engineer, a designer\u00a0and a knowledge specialist--nursing, physical therapy, psychology, counseling, sociology, biology or the arts.\u00a0With the right balance of technology aptitude, organizational and planning skills and sales and presentation prowess, a team has a fair shot at delivering an amazing idea that receives a great deal of attention.\u00a0We will host a team formation event at the beginning of the hackathon so that no one has to hack alone (unless they want to).\n\nTeams can be 2-4 people. You may have a bigger team, but your team wouldn\u2019t be eligible for the judging process or prizes. You can still work on a project in a bigger group or receive feedback on the project from mentors at the event.\u00a0\n\nNo, part of the excitement of this event is reinventing, repurposing, and redesigning applications, games, \u201cthings\u201d, concepts\u00a0and moon shots as an example\u00a0of\u00a0your ability to think out of the box.\n\nNo! \u00a0You and your team members will develop that pie in the sky idea at the event.\u00a0While you are free to begin dreaming or envisioning\u00a0now, no work or coding should take place prior to the event.\u00a0We want an even playing field. \u00a0Most people don\u2019t have an idea before they get to the event. But once you start talking to other people, you might come up with something. You can also work with somebody else on their idea if you like it. There are all types of ideas surrounding what health and wellness mean. \u00a0Think about what it means to you, your family, your community, and what it means economically, socially, globally, and environmentally. \u00a0We will have mentors to help prompt ideas if you and your team are really stuck. \u00a0Just know that there is no right or wrong answer.\n\nJudging will take place during the event by a panel of individuals representing a cross section of faculty, community members, and sponsors.\u00a0Submissions will need to be submitted by 6:00 AM for preliminary judging. \u00a0 Remember, submissions take time, so plan to load your project by \u00a05:50 AM to ensure it is posted by the deadline.\nWhat is a competition without prizes? Unlike a\u00a0day at school,\u00a0we expect you to teach us a thing or two and be rewarded.\u00a0\n\nOur Huskie Hack will invoke Safe Space rules.\u00a0A safe space is a place where anyone can relax and be fully self-expressed, without fear of being made to feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or unsafe on account of biological sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, cultural background, age, or physical or mental ability; a place where the rules guard each person\u2019s self-respect and dignity and strongly encourages everyone to respect others.\n\nAll participants will be expected to abide by the\u00a0\n.\u00a0When registering you will acknowledge receipt and acceptance in abiding by these rules.\nWho can I contact if I have further questions?\nEmail\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe participate as a\u00a0Major League Hacking (MLH) Member Event\nBy registering you authorize us to share certain application/registration information for event administration, ranking, MLH administration, pre and post-event informational e-mails, and occasional messages about hackathons in line with the MLH Privacy Policy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "$250 Amazon Web Services Credit", "prize-title": "Amazon Web Services - Best Use of AWS"}, {"prize-content": "Canbor VR Goggles Virtual Reality Headset VR Glasses for 3D Video Movies Games for Apple iPhone, Samsung Sony HTC More Smartphones and Pictek 104 Keys Anti-ghosting Backlit Mechanical Gaming Keyboard", "prize-title": "My Own World"}, {"prize-content": "Bear Grylls Ultimate Survival Kit", "prize-title": "I Will Survive!"}, {"prize-content": "Raspberry Pi & PiHut Essential Kit", "prize-title": "Best Domain Name from Domain.com"}, {"prize-content": "LuxFit Premium Fitness Exercise Ball Chairs For Home And Office 2 Year Warranty!
