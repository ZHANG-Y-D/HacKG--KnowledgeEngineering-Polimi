{"hackathon-description-text": "\nStuyHacks is a student-run hackathon taking place in the heart of Manhattan. We seek to expose as many high school and middle school students as possible to the creativity and innovation that technology brings. To us, hackathons are more than friendly competitions - they're opportunities to meet the great inventors, creators, and thinkers of the future. Our job is to eliminate the negative connotations that come with hacking and the technology field, and to instead replace them with the idea that coding something anyone can do, even in a weekend. We want to help trailblaze a new generation of diversity and enthusiasm for invention.
