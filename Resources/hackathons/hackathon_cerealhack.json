If you have questions, feel free to\u00a0\n.\nTo ensure a level field for all contestants, all code, design, art, music, SFX, and assets must be created during the duration of the Hackathon. We want to ensure that all participants start off on the same footing and we also want to preserve the true nature of a hackathon. You are, however, free to make plans, create wireframes, and brainstorm prior to the event. The only exception to this rule would include material that is freely available to the public. Some examples of this would be: public domain images, creative commons music, open source libraries. We take this rule very seriously for the sake of all members attending the event. Failure to comply may result in the offending team's disqualification.\nIf your team qualifies for prizes or is in the top five, the team will be subject to a code review to verify that there was no foul play.\nFeel free to use any tools, tricks, gems, shortcuts, or workarounds you\u2019ve discovered over the years to help you build quicker. Use any frameworks, hosting service, etc. you please.\n\u00a0\nAll teams retain full ownership of what they have created during the Hackathon.\n\u00a0\nTeams of up to 5 humans are allowed.\nWe welcome attendees from all backgrounds. This event is about increasing the overall amount of innovation, partnership, and engagement in our community.\n\u00a0\nBe kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a hackathon! Have fun, meet new people, learn new things. Event's like these are often life-changing, so make the most of it, relax, and enjoy the event.", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "Via Bosley Business Law", "prize-title": "Startup incorporation Package"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "UC Davis Entrepreneurship Academy"}, {"prize-content": "For top 3 placing teams.", "prize-title": "AWS Activate Program"}, {"prize-content": "via", "prize-title": "Leadwerks Indie License"}, {"prize-content": "via Hassan Rostam at", "prize-title": "Startup Financial Modeling Mentorship"}, {"prize-content": "3 months Hacker Lab membership for winning team!", "prize-title": "3 Month Hacker Lab Membership"}, {"prize-content": "For second and third place teams.", "prize-title": "1 Month Hacker Lab Membershp"}, {"prize-content": "Urban Hive full membership", "prize-title": "3 Month Urban Hive Membership"}, {"prize-content": "Wine provided by Parch'd", "prize-title": "Wine"}, {"prize-content": "Provided by Investor Fest Media", "prize-title": "No-fee access to MobiTech &amp; LifeScienceFest"}, {"prize-content": "Provided by Investor Fest Media", "prize-title": "All of TechCoire events in 2014"}, {"prize-content": "Services provided by Investorfest Media.", "prize-title": "Consulting &amp; Coaching services (if applicable) for fundraising"}, {"prize-content": "Provided by Green Right Media.", "prize-title": "Video Production: One video up to 3 minutes long for web viewing"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=1715 I Street, Sacramento, CA 95811, USA", "hackathon-url": "https://cerealhack.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}], "hackathon-location-address": "1715 I Street, Sacramento, CA 95811, USA", "hackathon-description-header": "Calling all coders, designers, biz devs, and hardware hackers!
