Teams can work on existing projects but during the presentation the team must clearly outline the part that was written during the hackathon and it shall be only judged on this part. Digital mockups and graphics may be prepared before. Additionally open-source frameworks and code that is available to everyone may be used. If you use another project of yours inside your hack it must be available to everyone and please mention it in the README in your repository.\nEven though the code quality is not a criteria, judges and organizers have to be granted a look on the source code on request. This might be necessary in cases where the judges or organziers question whether the code was written at the event.\nTeams of up to 4 humans are allowed.\u00a0\nAs we are hacking on a university campus, we need to be able to clearly identify participants and non-participants. That's why we ask everyone to wear the wristbands\u00a0we hand out and clearly display the badge with their name. It is also not permitted to pass either of it on to non-participants. If the organizers see such exchange the partcipant may be immediately banned from the event.\nIn order to participate in the actual competition and present your hack your team must be registered on the Devpost\u00a0page of the event.\nUntil submission deadline all teams must be registered and \n need to have joined the team. Additionally a link to the repository needs to be posted in the team page. Video submissions are optional.\nThe ownership for everything build at the event remains with the team and the team is free to do with it what it wants.\nIn order to participate in the competition it is necessary that you demo your hack at the expo. PowerPoint slides or other slide decks are not allowed. Neither at the expo nor at\u00a0the final presentations. Don't be scared to present unfinished hacks. You can still have a chance to win :)\nThe judging of the hackathon will have two phases. In the first phase every team has the chance to present to\u00a0some judges as part of the expo. Afterwards the\u00a0best teams will be chosen to present on stage in front of all participants and the final jury. Everyone who presents in front of the final\u00a0jury starts with a blank slate. Previous scores will not be counted for the final decision.\u00a0\nIn both cases the rule is that the decisions of the jury members and organizers are final and shall not be questioned.\nWe want a fair competition and are not planning to disqualify anyone however if any of the following things is violated we sadly have to disqualify you (and in cases your team):", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "Win Parrot jumping sumo drones for the most technically challenging hackathon project.", "prize-title": "Most technically challenging project"}, {"prize-content": "Win Zeiss VR One Plus headsets for the most disruptive hackathon project.", "prize-title": "Most disruptive project"}, {"prize-content": "Win Misfit Shine fitness trackers for the best \"strange but cool\" project.", "prize-title": "Hacker Spirit (\"Strange but cool\") prize"}, {"prize-content": "Best use of Skyscanner API", "prize-title": "Skyscanner API Prize"}, {"prize-content": "Win Amazon Echo for the best use of Amazon Alexa API", "prize-title": "Amazon Alexa API Prize"}, {"prize-content": "Win Pebble watches for best use for Twilio APIs.", "prize-title": "Twilio API prize"}, {"prize-content": "Win Raspberry Pis for the best best security / privacy focussed project", "prize-title": "CLIQZ best security / privacy focussed project award"}, {"prize-content": "Use your tech skills for good and hack online harassment.
