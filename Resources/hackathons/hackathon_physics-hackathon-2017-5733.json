{"hackathon-description-text": "\nComputational physics is the fusion of advanced computing techniques and scientific principles to explore virtually the uncharted world around us. Everything from games, planes, brains, DNA, automobiles and advanced materials is being developed at a lightning pace these days, in large part due to the computational tools available to scientists to explore the nature of how things work.

The only expection to this rule is content that is freely available to the public. For example, teams are welcome to reuse open source libraries and API's, creative commons media and public domain media. All submissions are subject to code review to ensure that this rule is obeyed.\u00a0\nHarassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.\nPhotography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).\nParticipants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.\nAs this is a hackathon, we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our hackathon are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.\nSponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.\nIf you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of hackathon staff immediately.\nHackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.\nIf a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organisers may take any action they deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the hackathon with no refund (if applicable), or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.\nWe expect participants to follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues and hackathon-related social events.\n", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "Tablets.", "prize-title": "Lenovo Prize"}, {"prize-content": "Ericsson will be rewarding the team with the best Internet Of Things (IoT) implementation, or alternatively with the most impressive communication effort for their Idea pitch.
