OpenBuild is a collaborative, time pressure event so feeling anxious is normal. Say you've showed up alone and want a team to work with. At the start, we will walk you through the schedule, rules and provisions for the day. After which, MonkeyBars will field questions and help people form teams and ideas.\u00a0\nBy lunch time, you'll be on the rails and the rest of it is up to you. Are you open to learning new skills? Can you step up and lead or follow someone else's lead? Is your idea fulfilling, without it winning a prize? OpenBuild has been most enjoyed when someone was filling a gap, whether it was personally or for a greater cause.\u00a0\n\n\nFood throughout the event including beverages and snacks.\nMentors from the various companies involved with skills ranging from construction and design to music and coding.\u00a0\nTools provided from sponsoring companies as well as basic prototyping materials.\u00a0\n\nYou sure can.
