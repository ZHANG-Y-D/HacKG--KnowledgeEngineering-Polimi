Please include the name of your app, how you created it, any APIs/hardware/libraries used and a photo of your hack in action!\nAt 6:30 PM, the hacking period will end, and we'll be transitioning to the Hackathon Showcase.\nDuring this time, there will be 2 teams of 4 judges. One team of judges will come by to your team, and you can present your hack to them for 3 minutes. This is going to be done science-fair style, so you'll just be demoing at your table. The judges will be focusing more on the technical side of your project, rather than a business pitch.\nAfter all the projects have been presented, each team of judges will come up with a list of their top 3 teams. The combined total of 6 teams will present to everyone, and the entire panel of 8 judges, at the closing ceremonies.\nAfter all teams have presented, the panel of 8 judges will determine the top 3 teams.\nAPI Prizes will be judged and presented by the Sponsor awarding it.", "hackathon-rules": "\n1.
