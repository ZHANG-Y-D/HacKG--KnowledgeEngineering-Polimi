Entrants to the AWH may be from any part of the world where the competition is lawful or entrants may receive a prize, but excepting those individuals, teams and organizations who are residents of, and organizations domiciled in Brazil, Quebec, Cuba, Sudan, Iran, North Korea, Syria and any other country designated by the United States Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Appian employees, employees of Devpost, AWH Judges and persons or entities employed by or employing a AWH Judge, employees of Appian\u2019s competitors and their immediate family members are not eligible to make submissions to the AWH. All entrants must complete an entry form accurately in order to be eligible. Appian may also exclude from the AWH any other individual or organization whose participation in the AWH would create, in the sole discretion of Appian and/or Devpost, a real or apparent conflict of interest or competitive conflict for Appian. Appian may disqualify an Entrant for tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Hackathon or to be acting in violation of these Official Rules or in a manner that is inappropriate, unsportsmanlike, not in the best interests of the AWH, or a violation of any applicable law or regulation. Appian shall have the right to determine all issues of eligibility in its sole discretion.\n\u00a0\n. Entrants may enter the AWH by visiting appian.devpost.com (\u201cHackathon Page\u201d). Entrants will complete an entry form and obtain access to a cloud instance of Appian\u2019s low-code platform software. Use of Appian\u2019s low-code platform will be subject to the license agreement related thereto. Appropriate entry forms must be completed before access is granted. Entry in the AWH constitutes consent for Appian and Devpost to collect and maintain an entrant\u2019s personal information for the purpose of operating the AWH and publicizing the AWH. Entrants may not use their access to the Appian software for the purpose of disassembling, decompiling, recreating, reproducing, or otherwise reverse engineering the Appian software or creating a product competitive to Appian. Any access to the Appian software granted for the purpose of entry into the AWH shall terminate at the conclusion of the AWH.\n\u00a0\nIf a team or organization is entering the AWH, they must appoint and authorize one individual (the \u201cRepresentative\u201d) to represent, act, and enter a Submission, on their behalf.

By entering a Submission on the Site on behalf of a team or organization you represent and warrant that you are the Representative authorized to act on behalf of your team or organization.\n\u00a0\nSubmissions to the AWH must meet the following requirements:\n\u00a0\n\n: Prior to the end of the Submission Period, you may save draft versions of your submission on Devpost to your portfolio before submitting the submission materials to the AWH or evaluation. Once the Submission Period has ended, you may not make any changes or alterations to your submission, but you may continue to update the project in your Devpost portfolio.\n: Appian may permit you to modify part of your submission after the Submission Period for the purpose of removing material that potentially infringes a third party mark or right, discloses personally identifiable information, or is otherwise inappropriate. The modified submission must remain substantively the same as the original submission with the only modification being what Appian permits.\n\u00a0\n. Eligible submissions will be evaluated by a panel of judges selected by Appian (the \u201cJudges\u201d). Judges may be employees of Appian or third parties, may or may not be listed individually on the Hackathon Website, and may change before or during the Judging Period. Judging may take place in one or more rounds with one or more panels of Judges, at the discretion of Appian.\nEntries will be judged on the following criteria, and according to the sole and absolute discretion of the judges selected by Appian:\n\u00a0\nThe three (3) Entrants whose submissions earn the highest overall scores based on the Judging Criteria will become potential winners of the First, Second and Third Prizes. Judges are not required to test the submission and may choose to judge based solely on the description, images and video provided in the submission.\u00a0 For each Prize listed in Section 7 below, if two or more submissions are tied, the tied submission with the highest score in the first applicable criterion listed above will be considered the higher scoring submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions\u2019 scores on the next applicable criterion. If two or more submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied submissions.\n\u00a0\n. All submissions remain the intellectual property of the individuals or organizations that developed them.
