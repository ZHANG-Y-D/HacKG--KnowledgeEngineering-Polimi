{"hackathon-description-text": "\nWelcome! Join us on Saturday, January 25th and learn more about real-time streaming data. This hackathon provides participants an opportunity to identify and extend applications leveraging streaming data to solve real world problems with InfoSphere\u00ae Streams, an advanced computing platform that allows user-developed applications to quickly ingest, analyze, and correlate information as it arrives from thousands of real-time sources. The solution can handle very high data throughput rates, up to millions of events or messages per second.\u00a0", "hackathon-number-of-prizes": "1", "hackathon-id": "ibminfospherehackathon", "hackathon-judges": [{"judge-role": "", "judge-name": "TBA"}], "hackathon-number-of-judges": "1", "hackathon-eligibility": "\nAll are welcome and eligible to participate in this challenge.\u00a0", "hackathon-number-of-participants": "21", "hackathon-is-colocated": "True", "hackathon-has-ended": "False", "hackathon-number-of-judging-criteria": "3", "hackathon-requirements": "\nAll submissions must use IBM InfoSphere Streams.
