The one (1) Maker who is eligible for the Best App by a Student Team Prize (see Section 9 for details) and earns the highest overall score based on the Judging Criteria, will become the potential winner of the Best App by a Student Team Prize listed in Section 8.\nThe Judging Criteria above may not apply to every Prize. See section 8 below for the Judging Criteria that apply for each Prize. The Maker(s) that are eligible for a Prize, and whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores based on the applicable Judging Criteria, will become potential winners of that Prize.\nJudges are not required to test the Application and may choose to judge based solely on the text description, images and video provided in the Submission.\u00a0\nThe Poster may, at their sole discretion, divide the judging process into phases. The Poster may appoint an internal panel of judges to evaluate all eligible Submissions and determine a smaller number of finalist Submissions. The finalist Submissions may then be submitted to a different panel of finalist judges (the \u201cJudges\u201d) who will evaluate only the finalist Submissions to determine the potential winners of the Prizes listed in Section 8 below.\u00a0The internal panel of judges and the finalist Judges will be appointed at the sole discretion of the Poster and will use the Judging Criteria in these Official Rules to evaluate Submissions. Only the finalist Judges will be identified on the Hackathon Website.\nFor each Prize listed in Section 8 below, if two or more Submissions are tied, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first applicable criterion listed above will be considered the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions\u2019 scores on the next applicable criterion. If two or more Submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Submissions.\n\nThe Popular Choice Award, described below in Section 8, will be determined by public voting. Public voting will take place during the Public Voting Period. The Poster and/or Administrator has the right to extend the Public Voting Period at any time for any reason.\nThe Popular Choice Award winner will be the eligible Submission with the highest number of verified votes received on the Submission\u2019s webpage on the Administrator\u2019s website during the Public Voting Period. Verified vote counts will be determined by the Administrator. If there is a tie between two or more Submissions, the winner will be the Submission with the highest score from the Judges based on the Judging Criteria, and if applicable the Tie Breaker procedure, described above in Section 6.\nPublic voting is open to any person with a verified Devpost account. Each person is limited to one vote per Submission and may only vote using one account. Makers may not directly or indirectly offer or pay any monetary or other form of consideration in exchange for a vote.\nYou many not use any manual or automated vote process or methods, or multiple e-mail addresses, to circumvent the one-vote limit per person per Submission. Doing so will subject all of your votes to disqualification. The Poster and/or Administrator may also disqualify a Maker, if the Maker receives multiple or irregular votes from the same user or users, receives votes in a manner that indicates manual, automated or other vote manipulation, or attempts to compensate voters.\nIf the voting process fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, the Poster has the right to determine the Popular Choice Award winner by using non-suspect votes, or by any other means they deem appropriate. If no alternative means of determining a winner of the Popular Choice Award is available or selected, the Poster may terminate the Popular Choice Award without designating a winner.\nThe Poster and Administrator are not responsible for, and are not required to count any vote which, in their judgment, is incomplete, late, misdirected, damaged, unlawful or illicit. This includes votes secured in breach of the voting rules above, as well as those lost for technical reasons, or otherwise in violation of these Official\u00a0Rules.\u00a0\n\n\nMakers eligible for the Best App by a Detroit Resident Prize and Best App by a Student Team are also eligible to win other prizes in the hackathon: First, Second, Third, Best App by a Detroit Resident (or Student Team), and Popular Choice Prizes described in Section 8.\n\nIn addition to the requirements in Section 3, Makers (including all team members, if a team submission) must:\n\nTHE AWARD OF A PRIZE TO A POTENTIAL WINNER IS SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION OF THE IDENTITY, QUALIFICATIONS AND ROLE OF THE POTENTIAL WINNER IN THE CREATION OF THE SUBMISSION.
