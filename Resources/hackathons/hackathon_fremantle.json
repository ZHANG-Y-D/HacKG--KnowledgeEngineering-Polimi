In the event Maker is required to include open source or public license technology or software in order to facilitate delivery of the Submission, it shall first disclose the inclusion of such software to FMNA in writing and obtain FMNA\u2019s prior written consent to include such software in the Submission. In the event FMNA approves the inclusion of such open source software in the Submission, Maker shall use best efforts to ensure that that inclusion of the open code software in the Submission shall not adversely impact FMNA\u2019s intellectual property rights in and to the Submission as set forth within these Official Rules.\nMaker further represents and warrants that the Submission (other than with respect to any materials provided by FMNA) does not contain any content or materials which are obscene, threatening, malicious, which infringe on or violate any applicable law or regulation or any proprietary, contract, moral, privacy or other third party right, or which otherwise expose FMNA to civil or criminal liability.\n\u00a0\nIf for any reason any Maker\u2019s Submission is determined to have not been received or been erroneously deleted, lost, or otherwise destroyed or corrupted, the Maker\u2019s sole remedy is to request the opportunity to resubmit its Submission.

Maker understands and agrees that FMNA\u2019s use of material containing features or elements similar or identical to those contained in Maker\u2019s Submission will not obligate FMNA to negotiate with Maker or entitle Maker to any compensation if FMNA determines that it has an independent legal right to use that other material for any reason (for example, because the features or elements are not new or novel, were not originated by Maker, or were or may hereafter be independently created and submitted by other persons, including FMNA employees).\n\nBy entering, all Makers (including, in the case of a team, all participating members) agree to be bound by the Official Rules and hereby release the Released Parties from any and all liability in connection with the Prizes or Maker\u2019s participation in the Hackathon.
