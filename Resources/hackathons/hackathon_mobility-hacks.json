But we have to set some simple rules to make it a honest and fair event for all:\n\nThis is, by all means, the most important rule. This is a very diverse environment, made up of many races, religions, sexual orientations, genders, and gender identities. Any behavior or presentation that objectifies or belittles others will be halted, with the presenters immediately disqualified and removed from the event.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a slidedeck hackathon! Build and demonstrate a working project or prototype, don\u2019t just show us screenshots and slides. Seriously, you will not win the hackathon by building some fake mock-up.\n\nThe project you present must be coded entirely during the Hackathon. The only exceptions are for publicly available frameworks/APIs and open-source code that has been available for at least a month. If it feels shady to use the code, don\u2019t.\n\nAll submissions but be in the food domain. Furthermore we prefer if all submitted entries directly address one or more of the event challenges, as described on our website to be eligible for posting. You will get a bonus during the judging process. If you think you don\u2019t need it, go ahead and build something completely different. \u00a0By submitting a solution, you grant us permission to display, copy, combine, compile, distribute and disseminate your Entry as needed to support the Event and audit your code. All Entries will be reviewed prior to posting.\n\nParticipants will have their code audited by us to make sure it\u2019s all new and legit. Your code belongs to you and we won\u2019t share it with anyone, but we will want to see it if you win. However, open sourcing the code is relatively normal at a hackathon.\n\nUse Git or an equivalent to track your code as you write it. It\u2019s good practice, and if it comes down to an audit, it\u2019ll help you prove your code is new.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an opportunity to promote your team\u2019s pre-existing product. Don\u2019t add one tiny feature onto your existing product and call it a day. Keep it honest and fair and build something new & exciting!\n\nYou must present your hack as described in your submission \u2013 if you deviate from your accepted submission, we\u2019ll have to boot you from the stage. Don\u2019t submit one thing and then abuse the stage and respect of the audience to present something different. Think about this presentation as combination of a pitch and a live demo. You only have 3 minutes, so hury yourself.\n\nWe\u2019re limiting the number of members per team at 5, in the interest of keeping things fair. You can also only be part of one team.\n\nAll intellectual property rights of hacks produced at the event belong to the attendees, and not to the organisers, sponsors, or partners.\n\nAt the registration of the event you have to sign that you agree, to be filmed and photographed at the event. In addition you allow us to use the shootage for advertising and promotion purposes.\nTLDR; you own the IP, be nice to each other and finally, regarding privacy, you will be at a public event that will be photographed and filmed. Hacks can be promoted and exhibited after the event (with credits and for non-commercial use only).
