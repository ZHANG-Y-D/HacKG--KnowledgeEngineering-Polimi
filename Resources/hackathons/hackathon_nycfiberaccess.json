The Sponsors will appoint a panel of qualified evaluators (\u201cReviewers\u201d) who will score each eligible Application on a 1-5 scale (5 being the highest and 1 being the lowest). Eligible Applications will be evaluated on the potential impact of fiber on the Applicant\u2019s business (including factors such as why the Applicant wants fiber internet connectivity at their Location, how it could benefit their business, and the Applicant\u2019s current internet connectivity), and the feasibility of fiber construction to the Applicant's building.\nC. All Reviewers shall be and remain fair. Any Reviewer may recuse him or herself from evaluating an Application if the Reviewer or the Sponsors consider that it is inappropriate, for any reason, for the Reviewer to evaluate a specific Application or group of Applications.

The Sponsors reserve the right to substitute or modify the Reviewers at any time for any reason.\nD. Applications that receive an aggregate score above 2 will be approved to advance (\u201cApproved Applicants\u201d).

ALL APPROVED APPLICANTS IN THE PROGRAM ARE SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION OF IDENTITY, ELIGIBILITY, AND ACCURACY OF THE APPLICATION BY THE SPONSORS, WHOSE DECISIONS ARE FINAL AND BINDING IN ALL MATTERS RELATED TO THE PROGRAM.\nB. In order to receive a Fiber Build-Out, each Approved Applicant will be required to:\u00a0\n(i) Sign a service contract for at least one year with a participating ISP within 90 business days of being first contacted by such ISP. The cost of the service contract will be at negotiated market rates. The cost for a one-year service contract varies depending on the package and the desired service features. For information on potential costs for their Location, Applicants are encouraged to Contact a \n providing service at their Location.\u00a0The negotiation of the service cost and the payment for service under the ISP service agreement is solely the responsibility of the Approved Applicant.\nC. At the sole discretion of the Sponsors, a Approved Applicant will be deemed ineligible for a Fiber Build-Out if:\u00a0\n(i) the Approved Applicant fails to respond within ten (10) business days to each of two or more attempts (where each attempt is ten (10) or more business days apart) by the participating ISP to engage them in negotiation of a service agreement;\n(ii) the Approved Applicant fails to sign a one-year service contract with a Participating ISP within 90 business days of first being contacted by such ISP; or\n(iii) the Application or the Approved Applicant or any member of a Approved Applicant\u2019s organization, is disqualified for any other reason.\u00a0 In the event of such disqualification, Sponsors, Administrator, and Participating ISPs at their sole discretion may award the applicable Fiber Build-Out to an alternate Approved Applicant.\nA. Fiber Build-Outs with an aggregate value of up to US $14,000,000 will be awarded in the Program (the \u201cFunding\u201d). Each Fiber Build-Out awarded will include the build-out of fiber internet connectivity to the Selected Applicant\u2019s Location. A Fiber Build-Out under the Program does not constitute a cash award. The Sponsors and/or participating ISPs will assume the construction and installation costs associated with the Fiber Build-Out. The Fiber Build-Out does not include service fees that are the sole responsibility of the Selected Applicant.\nB. Fiber Build-Outs will be awarded on a rolling basis until all of the Funding is committed OR until the Program Application Period has ended and there are no longer any Approved Applicants eligible to negotiate service contracts with participating ISPs. The Funding will be considered fully committed once the aggregate estimated build-out costs of Approved Applicants with signed service contracts reaches the value of the Funding. Once the Funding is fully committed, the Program Application Period will end (if before December 12, 2013) and any Approved Applicants without signed service contracts will no longer be eligible for a Fiber Build-Out under the Program.\nC. No Fiber Build-Out substitutions will be made. Fiber Build-Outs must be accepted as awarded. No transfer or substitution of a Fiber Build-Out is permitted except at the Sponsors\u2019 sole discretion. The Fiber Build-Out will be provided by the Participating ISP upon receipt of a signed service agreement for at least one year of service.\n\u00a0\nA.

Any attempt by any person to undermine the proper conduct of the Program may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, the Sponsors and the Administrator reserve the right to take proper legal action, including, without limitation, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unlawful activities.\nC. The Sponsors and/or the Administrator\u2019s failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. The Sponsors and the Administrator are not responsible for incomplete, late, misdirected, damaged, lost, illegible, or incomprehensible Applications or for address or email address changes of the Applicants. Proof of sending or submitting will not be deemed to be proof of receipt by Sponsors or Administrator.\nD.
