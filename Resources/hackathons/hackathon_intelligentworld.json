If two or more Submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Submissions.\nAll prize awards are subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with these Official Rules. Sponsors reserve the right to examine Submissions for compliance with the Competition Rules. Prize winners may, subject to applicable laws and regulations, be screened to ensure they are not included on any Government Watch List.\nAll decisions of the Posters and Judges will be final and binding on all matters relating to this Competition.

That official representative will have sole responsibility for further distribution of any cash award among participants in a Team Submission or within a company or institution that has submitted a Submission through that representative. No substitution or transfer of prize awards is permitted. The cash prize will be awarded per winning Submission, not per Maker or number of persons involved in the Submission.\nThis is a contest of skill.
