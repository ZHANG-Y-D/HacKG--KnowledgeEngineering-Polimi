Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to ensure a safe environment for everybody.\n\u00a0\nOur hackathon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, previous hackathon attendance or computing experience (or lack of any of the aforementioned). We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any hackathon venue, including hacks, talks, workshops, parties, social media and other online media. Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon without a refund (if applicable) at the discretion of the hackathon organisers.\n\u00a0\nhttp://hackcodeofconduct.org/techfestmunich", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "We are looking for a way to understand this type of data.

Most working steps are done manually, compounds are made on multi-milligram scale, and the overall throughput per chemist is limited. We aspire to completely transform the iterative design, synthesis and screening of molecules by applying modern automation, machine learning, and miniaturisation techniques to early discovery activities such as chemistry and biology. There are significant technical challenges involved; particularly managing a large diverse array of reagents some of which are air and moisture sensitive, telescoping and integrating multiple reaction steps and replicating the manual dexterity and on-the-fly problem solving of a skilled synthesis chemist.", "prize-title": "AstraZeneca Challenge: The chemistry lab of the future"}, {"prize-content": "In past few decades Football as a sport hasn\u2019t seen a lot of technological innovation.
