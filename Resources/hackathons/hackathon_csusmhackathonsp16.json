She had an assignment in Dr. Solomon\u2019s web design class to create a site about an issue or crisis that impacts our community here as well as globally. Although the refugee crisis seems distant, human needs connect all people. her design idea is a campaign that focuses on bringing families together around the globe, so that families with stability can connect to families in need. \u00a0\nThe app that she has in mind is similar to a dating site. It matches people or families in stable areas to refugee families. Ideally, the app would allow people to choose either the needs they can help with or if you are a refugee, the needs you may have. From there, it would create a match between the two sides and allows them the opportunity to connect. As a designer, she created a concept for the app at\nSamia Carrillo-Percastegui and Mathias Tobler have been studying large mammals but focusing on jaguars in the Peruvian Amazon for over a decade, including large-scale camera trap surveys and collaring of jaguars with GPS collars, leading to very detailed data on jaguar ecology. Recently they started a project looking at human-jaguar interactions and the attitudes of local communities towards this top predator. One of their goals is to teach communities more about the jaguars and their prey and to find ways to minimize human-jaguar conflicts that often lead to the killing of jaguars.\u00a0You are invited to explore new ways of visualizing and communicating interesting facts about jaguar ecology, the importance of jaguar in the ecosystem, and jaguar threats to local communities in Peru as well as a broader audience in the US. Find creative ways to show local people that the jaguar is an important part of the ecosystem and that the conservation of the species has benefits for everybody. The hope is that better education will lead to more protection of jaguars or at least to less killing. They would like to target a young audience at first, given the technology access and open mind that young people have.\nFor camera trapping:\n\u00a0", "hackathon-rules": "\n\n\nThese are the Official Rules that govern how the Women\u2019s Hackathon operates (the \"Contest\").
