In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions\u2019 scores on the next applicable criterion. If two or more Submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Submissions.\n\nAll decisions of the Posters and Judges will be final and binding on all matters relating to this Hackathon.\nAll prize awards are subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with these Official Rules.
