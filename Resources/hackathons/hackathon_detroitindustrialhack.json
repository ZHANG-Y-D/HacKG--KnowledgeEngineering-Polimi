However:\nPredix does require software coding skills. While most skills are quite common in a developer\u2019s portfolio, not all of them are (e.g. CF CLI). In particular also, mastering the powerful and uncompromising security scheme can be a challenge though for starters. Also consider that you will run a \u201cPlatform-Hackathon\u201d. A developer needs to understand how to navigate the Predix platform, how to deploy services, and so forth. We recommend six (6) hours at very minimum learning, even for experienced software developers. (Caution: Don\u2019t confuse that with an \u201cAPI-Hackathon\u201d, which is common in the consumer space, e.g. using Google Map API. A simple API can be learned often in 20 minutes or less. However that is NOT sufficient for a \u201cPlatform-Hackathon\u201d such as in the case of Predix).\nImportant: See below for Predix training recommendations.\nGeneral software skills requirements\n(by hackathon team, not by each developer):\n\u00a0\n\nAll submissions done via Devpost, at detroitindustrialhack.devpost.com\nIf you have not created a Devpost account yet and registered, you should.\nBelow are the requirements for submitting the application.\n\nBrief description of the application\n\nProblem statement of the application and the logic it will use to solve the problem\n\nHow does the user interface with the application and what kind of features does it have\n\nDescribe tech stack that was used to build your application\n\n\u00a0\nParticipants \u2013 Recommended Training\nSelf Paced Learning Content\nRecommended:\n\u00a0\nAdditional Content: Optional", "hackathon-rules": "\n\n\n20900 Oakwood Boulevard, Dearborn, MI 48124, US)\nAt the Eventbrite registration page, you will find and must follow further instructions for submitting your completed proposal (your \u201cSubmission\u201d).
