This policy is based on several other policies, including the Ohio LinuxFest anti-harassment policy, written by Esther Filderman and Beth Lynn Eicher, and the Con Anti-Harassment Project. Mary Gardiner, Valerie Aurora, Sarah Smith, and Donna Benjamin generalized the policies and added supporting material. Many members of LinuxChix, Geek Feminism and other groups contributed to this work.\nAll Code for Pakistan network activities, events, and digital forums and their staff, presenters, and participants are held to an anti-harassment policy, included below. In addition to governing our own events by this policy, Code for Pakistan will only lend our brand and fund groups that offer an anti-harassment policy to their attendees.\nFor information on how to offer an anti-harassment policy to your group, see this guide. Code for Pakistan is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of staff, presenters, and participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Code for Pakistan event or network activity, including talks.\nAnyone in violation of these policies may be expelled from Code for Pakistan network activities, events, and digital forums, at the discretion of the event organizer or forum administrator. Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; unwarranted exclusion; and patronizing language or action. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from Code for Pakistan network activities, events, and digital forums.\u00a0\nIf you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff or forum administrator immediately. You can contact them. Event staff or forum administrators will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. If you cannot reach an event organizer or forum administrator and/or it is an emergency, please remove yourself from the situation. You can also contact Code for Pakistan about harassment at info@codeforpakistan.org . Code for Pakistan staff acknowledge that we are not always in a position to evaluate a given situation due to the number of events and the fact that our team is not always present.\nHowever, we are hopeful that by providing these guidelines we are establishing a community that jointly adheres to these values and can provide an environment that is welcoming to all. We value your attendance and hope that by communicating these expectations widely we can all enjoy a harassment free environment.", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "1st Prize"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "2nd Prize"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "3rd Prize"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "4th Prize"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Audience Favourite"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=PTCL NOC, 6 Street 6, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan", "hackathon-url": "https://isbhacks2017.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": "All the development work on the project must be done during the hackathon time period."}, {"judging-criterion": "Does the project solve a relevant problem for the targeted SDG(s)?"}, {"judging-criterion": "User experience must be intuitive and clear"}, {"judging-criterion": "Does your solution solve a problem in a novel way?"}, {"judging-criterion": "Is the solution sustainable and scalable?"}], "hackathon-location-address": "PTCL NOC, 6 Street 6, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan", "hackathon-description-header": "SDG Hackathon - Ignite Civic Innovation", "hackathon-prizes-total": "PKR200,000", "hackathon-location-description": "National Incubation Center", "hackathon-end-date": "2017-08-20", "has-projects": "True"}
