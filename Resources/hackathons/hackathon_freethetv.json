The Administrator\u2019s computer is the official time keeping device for this Challenge.\nTo officially enter the Challenge, you must complete the Registration and Submission processes, as further detailed below, during the Challenge Submission Period.\nTo enter the Challenge, you must register and submit a qualifying application in accordance with the following:\nIn the event of a dispute as to any registration of a ChallengePost account, the authorized account holder of the email address used to register at \n will be deemed to be the registrant and the Contestant. The \u201cauthorized account holder\u201d is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Potential winners may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder.\nEach Contestant grants to the Sponsor and the Administrator, and any third parties acting on behalf of the Sponsor and/or the Administrator, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide license to display publicly and use for promotional purposes their Submission in perpetuity. This license includes posting or linking to the Submission on the official Sponsor and Administrator websites and partner websites.\nIn addition, Samsung reserves the right to publish any and all Submissions. In connection with the publication of any Submission, Samsung may require further development of the application and/or changes to the User Interface / User Experience aspects of the application before submitting it to Samsung\u2019s customary pre-publication quality assurance testing.\nSubmissions will be posted on \n on a rolling basis after being screened by the Sponsor and/or the Administrator for basic functionality, accuracy of messaging, and integrity (i.e., security). All Contestants will have equal access to Submissions posted on the website. Non-Contestants interested in the Challenge are also encouraged to register on \n. Registration will be required in order to receive updates on the Challenge.\nSubmissions will initially be screened by a qualified internal panel selected by the Sponsor at its sole discretion. The internal panel will judge the Submissions on the criteria identified below to select finalist Submissions. Then the finalist Submissions will be judged by an expert judging panel determined by the Sponsor. Sponsor reserves the right to substitute or modify the judging panel at any time for any reason. Judges have the right to withdraw without advance notice in the event of extenuating circumstances beyond their control. Judges will be fair and impartial. A judge may elect to recuse himself or herself from judging a Submission if, in the judge\u2019s sole discretion, it is not appropriate for him or her to judge that particular Submission because of a past or current relationship with that particular Contestant. A Submission will not be at a disadvantage if one or more judge recuses him or herself. Odds of winning depend on the number of eligible Submissions received and the quality of the Submissions. The approximate dates for the judging panel are between December 2, 2011 at 10:00 AM EST and December 16, 2011 at 5:00 PM EST.\nThe judging panel will judge each finalist Submission on the following three criteria: (1) Overall Visual Appeal; (2) Quality and Innovation of the Idea; and (3) Functional Implementation. The three (3) Contestants whose Submissions earn the highest overall score will win the prizes identified below in section 9. In the event of a tie, the winner will be selected based on the criteria described in (1), then (2), and finally (3). If there is still a tie then the winner will be selected based on a vote by the judging panel, which will likely consist of an odd number of judges.\nALL POTENTIAL CHALLENGE WINNERS ARE SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION BY SPONSOR AND/OR ADMINISTRATOR WHOSE DECISIONS ARE FINAL AND BINDING IN ALL MATTERS RELATED TO THE CHALLENGE.\nPotential winners must continue to comply with all terms and conditions of these Official Rules, and winning is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements.

The official winners will be announced on January 13, 2012.\nFor all Prizes: Delivery of prizes will be paid for by Sponsor.
