If Sponsor determines (at any time and in its sole discretion) that any winner or potential winner is disqualified, ineligible, in violation of these Terms, or engaging in behavior that Sponsor deems obnoxious, inappropriate, threatening, illegal or that is intended to annoy, abuse, or harass any other person or entity, Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify such winner or potential winner, even if the disqualified winner or potential winner may have been notified or displayed or announced anywhere. Sponsor\u2019s failure to or decision not to enforce any provision in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of that or any other provision. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these Terms will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. In the event that any provision is determined to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, these Terms will otherwise remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with their terms as if the invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein. If the Contest is not capable of running as planned for any reason, Sponsor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel, modify or suspend the Contest and award the prize based on eligible Entries received prior to cancellation, modification, or suspension, if any, or as otherwise deemed fair and appropriate by Sponsor.
