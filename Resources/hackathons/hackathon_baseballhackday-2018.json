That is why we have a\u00a0\n. All attendees, sponsors, partners, volunteers and staff at our hackathon are required to agree with it. We want a safe, fair and fun environment for everybody.\nWe are using a hack submission service called\u00a0\n. In order to win, you need to submit the hacks through it. It helps organizers keep track of the teams and the projects they create.\nHacks could be (but are not limited to) a tool, application, software, website, or data visualization and may be built using any programming language and platform that you choose. Teams can be of any size, but awards are only given to up to four individuals. Hacks will be judged for 1) Creativity/Originality, 2) Design/Presentation, and 3) Execution/Functionality.\nThe majority of your coding must happen during the event. Some work done prior to the event is allowed, but it should be disclosed at your demo. Ideas that are compact and executable in one-day format are encouraged, and we will reward teams that recognize this time constraint.\nWhen time is up, you will have short show-and-tell and demo time (3 to 5 minutes, depending on how many projects there are). Judges also will come around during the event and you are encouraged to tell them about your projects at that time.\nPrototypes/mockups for demo are OK, but working websites or mobile apps are strongly encouraged.", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "The team who takes the grand prize (best of the winning teams of participating cities) will also receive additional prizes (and major bragging rights!)", "prize-title": "Baseball Hack Day Grand Prize Winner"}, {"prize-content": "MLB.tv Subscription", "prize-title": "Boston Winner"}, {"prize-content": "MLB.tv Subscription", "prize-title": "Montreal Winner"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Toronto Winner"}, {"prize-content": "MLB.tv Subscription", "prize-title": "Chicago Winner"}, {"prize-content": "MLB.tv Subscription.", "prize-title": "San Diego Winner"}, {"prize-content": "MLB.tv Subscription", "prize-title": "Toronto 2nd Place"}, {"prize-content": "BP subscription", "prize-title": "Boston Runner up"}, {"prize-content": "BP subscription", "prize-title": "Toronto Runner Up"}, {"prize-content": "BP subscription", "prize-title": "San Diego Runner Up"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Toronto 3rd place"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "", "hackathon-url": "https://baseballhackday-2018.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}], "hackathon-location-address": "", "hackathon-description-header": "One-day, multi-city coding competition for baseball fans where Tech & Sports collide.", "hackathon-prizes-total": "$3,000", "hackathon-location-description": "Multiple cities", "hackathon-end-date": "2018-03-17", "has-projects": "True"}
