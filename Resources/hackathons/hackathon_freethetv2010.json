Registered Contestants will then be able to enter a submission (\u201c_Submission_\u201d). In the event of a dispute as to any registration, the authorized account holder of the email address used to register at \n will be deemed to be the registrant or player. The \u201cauthorized account holder\u201d is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Potential winners may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder.\nEach Contestant grants to Sponsor, Administrator, and others acting on behalf of Sponsor, a royalty-free non-exclusive worldwide license to display publicly and use for promotional purposes their Submission in perpetuity. This license includes posting or linking to the Submission on the official Sponsor and Administrator websites and partner websites.\nSubmissions will be posted on \n on a rolling basis after being screened by the Administrator for basic functionality, accuracy of messaging, and integrity (i.e., security). All Contestants will have equal access to Submissions posted on the website. Non-Contestants interested in the Challenge are also encouraged to register on \n . Registration will be required in order to receive updates on the Challenge and vote for the Popular Choice Award. Registered visitors will be able to vote for their favorite Submission. The public voting will take place between on or about November 22, 2010 at 12:00 PM EST and December 16, 2010 at 5:00 pm EST. Public voting will determine the winner of the Popular Choice Award. Each registered visitor is able to vote for their favorite Submissions, but may only vote for a Submission once during the voting period.  Use of an automated process or similar device to submit an electronic vote is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to circumvent the one vote limit per Submission or to use automated vote process will subject all votes from the person to disqualification. If a Contestant receives multiple and/or irregular votes from the same user or users, including but not limited to, votes generated by a robotic, programmed, script, macro, other automated means or other source,  the Sponsor and/or Administrators reserves the right to disqualify the Contestant in their sole discretion. If the voting process for the Popular Choice Award fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, the Sponsor and/or Administrators in their sore discretion reserves the right to use another means to determine the winner of the Popular Choice Award, i.e. random selection or appointing a panel of judges. Contestants may not pay people or provide any other type of consideration in exchange for votes. Any Contestant who violates the ban on paying or providing consideration in exchange for votes will be disqualified. Public votes may be displayed on the competition website, on a real-time basis, before being verified for integrity. These unverified votes do not necessarily reflect accurately the winner of the Popular Choice Award. The winner of the Popular Choice Award will be the entrant(s) who are contacted directly by the Administrator or Sponsor after votes have been verified. Sponsor reserves the right to modify the voting period at anytime for any reason.\nSubmissions will initially be screened by a qualified internal panel selected by the Sponsor at its sole discretion. The internal panel will judge the Submissions on the criteria identified below to select finalist Submissions. Then the finalist Submissions will be judged by an expert judging panel determined by the Sponsor that may include Mike Maples, Jr., (Floodgate), Bob Borchers (Opus Capital), Roelof Botha (Sequoia Capital), Jeremy Levine (Bessemer Venture Partners), and Eric Anderson (Samsung). Sponsor reserves the right to substitute or modify the judging panel at any time for any reason. Judges do have the right to withdrawal without advance notice in the event of extenuating circumstances beyond their control.\nJudges will be fair and impartial. A judge may elect to recuse him or herself from judging a Submission, if in the judge\u2019s sole discretion it is not appropriate for him or her to judge that particular Submission because of a past or current relationship with that particular Contestant. A Submission will not be at a disadvantage if one or more judge recuses him or herself.\nOdds of winning depend on the number of eligible Submissions received and the quality of the Submissions. The approximate dates for the judging panel are between November 22, 2010 at 12:00 PM EST and December 16, 2010 at 5 pm EST.\nThe judging panel will judge each finalist Submission on the following three criteria: (1) Overall Visual Appeal; (2) Quality of the Idea; and (3) Functional Implementation. The thirteen (13) Contestants whose Submissions earn the highest overall score will win the prizes identified below in section 9, with the exception of the Popular Choice Award. In the event of a tie, winner will be selected based on the criteria described in (1), then (2), and finally (3). If there is still a tie then the winner will be selected based on a vote by the judging panel, which will likely consist of an odd number of judges.\nOne (1) winner will be based solely on the voting of registered visitors to \n. If there is a tie between one or more Submissions for the Popular Choice Award, the cash prize will be split equally amongst the tied Contestants and each Tied Contestant will receive a Samsung 46\u201d TV.\nThe Corporate Recognition Award is a non-cash recognition award intended to encourage organizations with fifty (50) or more employees. Each finalist Submission for the Corporate Recognition Award will be scored by the judging panel on the following three criteria: (1) Visual Appeal; (2) Quality of the Idea; and (3) Functional Implementation. If there is still a tie then the winner will be selected based on a vote by the judging panel, which will consist of an odd number of judges.\nALL POTENTIAL CHALLENGE WINNERS ARE SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION BY SPONSOR AND/OR ADMINISTRATOR WHOSE DECISIONS ARE FINAL AND BINDING IN ALL MATTERS RELATED TO THE CHALLENGE.\nPotential winners must continue to comply with all terms and conditions of these Official Rules, and winning is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements.

In the event that a potential winner of a Challenge prize is disqualified for any reason, Sponsor may award the applicable prize to an alternate winner who had the highest score remaining of the eligible entries.\n\nFor all Prizes: Delivery of prizes will be paid for by Sponsor.
