{"hackathon-description-text": "\nETS is looking for developers and educators to create a game that acts as a math assessment. We\u2019re looking for innovative ideas that produce evidence of students\u2019 knowledge, skills, and abilities in mathematics. The assessment tasks should be based on a Learning Progression for some field of mathematics in K-12.

By entering the ETS Challenge you agree that your participation will be governed by, and you shall abide by, all of the following terms and conditions herein and in the Submission Agreement:\n1. \n\u00a0 The goal of the ETS Electronic Assessment Design Competition is to challenge emerging and experienced game developers and educators to design games and apps for students (grades K through 12th) that assess math knowledge and concepts and foster an interest in STEM subject areas. ETS Challenge entrants are invited to submit a working prototype (amongst other things, as more fully detailed in Section 4 below) for concepts that push the boundaries of game-based assessment among sudents in Kindergarten through High School (\"\n\"). \u00a0\n2. \n is offered and open only to all natural persons, age 18 and older as of the date of entry, who are legal residents of the United States of America for the duration of the ETS Challenge.\u00a0 Employees, independent contractors, officers, and directors of ETS, its affiliates and/or subsidiaries, ETS's advertising, promotion and fulfillment agencies and legal advisors, and the immediate family members and persons living in the same household of such persons, are not eligible to participate in the ETS Challenge.\n3.\n The entry period for the ETS Challenge begins May 1, 2012 and ends August 17, 2012 (the \"\n\").\n4. \n\u00a0 To enter, visit www.etsgameschallenge.com (the \"\n\") during the Entry Period and follow the entry instructions. All Submissions (as defined below) must be in the English language and completed and received in their entireties by ETS by no later than 11:59 PM August 17, 2012 to be eligible.
