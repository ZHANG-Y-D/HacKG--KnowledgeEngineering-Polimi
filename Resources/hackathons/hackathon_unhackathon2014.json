{"hackathon-description-text": "\nWe\u2019re building a hackathon where talented makers and creators of all kinds can code their hearts out. We emphasize mentorship, learning, and diversity of hackers and awards, hoping to find not just the coolest hacks, but the greatest. Our awards will recognize qualities like technical ambition, thoughtful code, inspired design, and potential for improvements beyond the hackathon. Unhackathon will take place over 36 hours from September 20 to 21st. We hope to encourage hackers to learn new skills and technologies by making API resources, hardware and interesting data sets available to everyone. We\u2019ll also have everything you\u2019ll need to be productive - many inspiring workings spaces to fit your mood, energy drinks and healthy snacks and meals, and advice from the greatest mentors ever. Our mentors come from the best NYC tech companies and startups, and will be around the whole time to help you with everything from ideas to bugs.", "hackathon-number-of-prizes": "15", "hackathon-id": "unhackathon2014", "hackathon-judges": [{"judge-role": "", "judge-name": "Will Be Announced Soon!"}], "hackathon-number-of-judges": "1", "hackathon-eligibility": "\nUnhackathon is open to any undergraduate who wants to spend a weekend building something great!
