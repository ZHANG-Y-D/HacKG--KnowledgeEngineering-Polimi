The event will kick off with each team sharing what they are aiming to build and have completed by that evening - 12 hours later. Teams will be able ( and encouraged ) to help eachother if they wish. If someone needs some solder, a resistor, etc, we encourage others to steps up and help. At the end of the day there will be presentations by each team on what they completed. Finally, a public vote by all in attendance will decide the winners. The top 3 teams will all receive prizes for their efforts.\nTry to build the best IoT solution that you can with the tools and time you are given.
