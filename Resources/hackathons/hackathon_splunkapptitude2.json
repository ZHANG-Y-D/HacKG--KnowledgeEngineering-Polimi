As described below, for entries into the Social Impact Category, the dataset must consist of \u201copen data\u201d \u2013 meaning data that is publicly available and free to use, reuse, and redistribute. Use of open data is not required for the Insider Threat and Fraud Category or the Innovation Category, but is encouraged as it will ensure that Sponsor has the unfettered dataset access required for this Contest. Visit the Contest Site at splunk.challengepost.com/details/data to access Splunk\u2019s suggested open datasets (which may be added to over the course of the Contest Period).\nYour Application, Video, and all other Entrant Content (defined below) you submit in this Contest must comply with the Submission Requirements set forth in that section below. As described below, Applications entered into this Contest will be judged \u2013 in part \u2013 on how innovative and creative they are.

Dataset content must be civic-based, meaning it must relate to a country, state, city, county or region, or other public jurisdiction; and/or residents or citizens of a country, state, city, county or region, or other public jurisdiction. Datasets do not have to be issued by a government entity as long as the dataset content is civic-based and publicly accessible. Compliance with this requirement will be determined at the sole discretion of the Sponsor.\nEntrant\u2019s Application must be hosted on the web in a location accessible by Sponsor and include clickable and interactive features that work in a desktop web browser. To complete the Entry Form, each entrant must provide a link to his/her/its Application as hosted in a Sponsor-accessible location on the web (\u201cApplication Link\u201d) in the \u201cWebsite URL\u201d or similar field of the Entry Form. Application must be available through the Application Link, free of charge and without any restriction, for testing, evaluation and use by the Sponsor and the Judges (defined below) during the Contest Period and throughout winner selection and award of the prizes in this Contest or entrant will be disqualified. In addition to the Application Link, each entrant must provide Sponsor with administrator credentials to a live, password-protected instance of the Splunk software with the Application installed. The administrator credentials provided must grant Sponsor full administrative access into the Splunk instance and full access to the operating system in order to validate the contents and structure of the entrant\u2019s Application, without the need for Sponsor to schedule time with the entrant. (Administrator credentials should be provided, as described above, as a separate PDF, Word, or other text file uploaded in connection with submission of the Entry Form.) Entrant will be disqualified if entrant fails to grant Sponsor the required administrator access or if the access granted to the account prevents Sponsor\u2019s unfettered evaluation of the Application and any other Entrant Content hosted in connection with the Application.\n: Entries must be submitted through the Contest Site during the Contest Period, as described below. However \u2013 after initial submission of an Entry Form, but prior to the conclusion of the Contest Period \u2013 entrant may modify his/her/its Application and other Entrant Content. At the close of the Contest Period, the entry (including all Entrant Content comprising the entry) will be considered final and entrant may not make any further modifications to the Entrant Content, including any modifications to demo system or Splunk configuration. During the judging and winner verification processes, Sponsor will validate that each potentially winning entrant has made no modifications to its Entrant Content as it was submitted at the close of the Contest Period. Any potentially winning entrant found to have impermissibly modified its Entrant Content after the close of the Contest Period (other than as required by Sponsor as part of the \u201ccleaning\u201d process, described below) may, in Sponsor\u2019s sole discretion, be disqualified.\nYou will not engage directly or indirectly in any work or undertaking, which shall conflict with or create any legal or contractual impediment against your performance of the obligations under these Official Rules, and by participating in the Contest, you represent and warrant there is no such present conflict of interest or any such legal or contractual impediment.

The Contest Site's server will be the official timekeeper for this Contest. Only entries that are recorded as complete by the Contest Site during the Contest Period will be considered. There is no limit on the number of entries per entrant (individual, Team, or Organization) provided that each Application submitted is unique (as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion) and provided that no entrant may win more than one (1) prize in this Contest, as detailed below. Each entrant should review all information for accuracy purposes and make all corrections necessary to inaccurate data before his/her/its entry is finalized at the close of the Contest Period. Other proof of submitting or attempting to submit an entry (such as, without limitation, a printed, saved or copied automated receipt confirming entry or a \"thanks for entering\" screen or message) does not constitute proof of actual receipt of the entry for purposes of this Contest. Those who do not abide by these Official Rules or the instructions of Sponsor and provide all required information will be disqualified in Sponsor's sole discretion.

To the extent required by applicable law only, the consent of the entrant to grant the use and exploitation rights to the Sponsor shall not be construed as an assignment or waiver to any of his/her moral rights which, under applicable laws, may not constitute the object of any transfer or waiver whatsoever.\nAs between Sponsor and each participant, participant retains ownership of all intellectual property rights in and to the Entrant Content, aside from the license rights granted in these Official Rules and those granted under the Developer License. Without limiting the rights granted to Sponsor and other parties by participant under the Developer License, each participant - as a condition of entry - grants to Sponsor a perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, and otherwise use any Entrant Content (including the Application) in any medium now known or hereafter devised (including online and in digital media), without further obligation or compensation of any kind to Entrant, for the exclusive purposes of (i) administering this Contest (including, without limitation, allowing Sponsor and Judges to test and evaluate the Application and other Entrant Content) and (ii) for any advertising, promotional, or publicity purpose.

Sponsor reserves the right to request from entrant, at any time and in a form deemed acceptable to Sponsor in its sole discretion, proof that entrant maintains all necessary rights in his/her/its Entrant Content in order to grant the applicable rights required herein. Failure to provide such proof may lead to, among other things, the entrant being disqualified from the Contest.\nBy entering, you acknowledge and understand that Sponsor and other entrants in this Contest may have independently developed (or currently be developing) applications and other content (including other Applications entered into this Contest) that may be similar to or identical to your Entrant Content in terms of theme, idea, function, or in other respects. You agree that you will not be entitled to any rights in, or compensation in connection with, any such similar or identical applications, content, and/or ideas. You acknowledge that you have submitted your Entry voluntarily and not in confidence or in trust. You acknowledge that no confidential, fiduciary, agency or other relationship or implied-in-fact contract now exists between you and Sponsor, that no such relationship is established by your submission of any Entrant Content to Sponsor under these Official Rules, and that Sponsor\u2019s only obligations to you regarding any Entrant Content are as specifically set forth in these Official Rules.\n4.
