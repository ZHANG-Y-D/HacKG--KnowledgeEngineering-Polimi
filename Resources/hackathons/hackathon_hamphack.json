At Hamp Hack, we are doing it different. \u00a0 People from different fields involved in technology, design/fabrication and art collaborate intensively on developing working prototypes that attempt to solve problems resonating in the world around us. With this event, the aim is to provide students with a platform that gives their unique idea an escape velocity into reality.

Make sure that your behavior is under this \n.\nThis is not a presentation-athon. Make something that's working and try to push your thinking forward.\nThe project must be developed entirely during the hackathon hours only.\nMake sure you're only a team of 4 or 5 at max.\nMake somthing that's a blend of different subjects, this will allow you to think in new directions.\nDont just make something that solves a problem. Make something that solves a problem AND also leverages the way people function.\nDon't be bogged down into thinking that your project is very \"ambitious\" or \"undoable\".

It could include apps that can help an institution or an individual keep track of unsustainable resource use, make better informed choices or spread awareness in an interesting way. It could also include physical products that maximize resource use/cut down on energy being used: like maybe a product that reduces water/electricity usage, or a product that people would use in their day to day lives running completely on renewable energy.", "prize-title": "Amazon Echo (Environmental Sustainability Prize)"}, {"prize-content": "The prize for this category will be awarded to the project that best integrates the existing knowledge about the brain (either electrophysiological or anatomical) and technology to create an interesting product.
