In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated by comparing the tied Submissions\u2019 scores on the second, and third criterion listed above, respectively. If two or more Submissions are tied on all three criteria, the panel of Judges, in its sole discretion, will vote on the tied submissions (the \u201cTie-Breaker Vote\u201d).\nD.

Large Organizations are not eligible to compete for or win the Best MTA Wish List App Prize.\nA. The public voting is scheduled to take place between August 26, 2013 at 9:00am Eastern Time, USA and September 10, 2013 at 5:00pm Eastern Time, USA (the \u201cVoting Period\u201d).
