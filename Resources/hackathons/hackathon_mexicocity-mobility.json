Judging may take place in one or more rounds with one or more panels of Judges, at the discretion of the Poster.\nEligible Submissions will be evaluated by a panel of judges selected by the Poster (the \u201cJudges\u201d), and scored using the following criteria (the \u201cJudging Criteria\u201d):\n(i)\u00a0\nIncludes creativity and originality of the idea.)\n(ii)\u00a0\nIncludes how well the idea was executed by the developer.)\n(iii)\u00a0\nIncludes the extent to which the Application mitigates traffic congestion and increases vehicle occupancy.)\n(iv) \n(Includes the extent to which the Application may increase the safety and enjoyment of a driver\u2019s commute, as well as encourage positive human interactions.)\nThe three (3) Makers whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores based on the Judging Criteria, will become potential winners of the Grand, Second and Third Prizes listed in Section 8.

See section 8 below for the Judging Criteria that apply for each Prize. The Maker(s) that are eligible for a Prize, and whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores based on the applicable Judging Criteria, will become potential winners of that Prize.\nJUDGES are not required to test the Application and may choose to judge based solely on the text description, IMAGES and video provided in the Submission.\u00a0\nThe Poster may, at their sole discretion, divide the judging process into phases.

Only the finalist Judges will be identified on the Challenge Website.\nFor each Prize listed in Section 8 below, if two or more Submissions are tied, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first applicable criterion listed above will be considered the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions\u2019 scores on the next applicable criterion. If two or more Submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Submissions.\n\u00a0\nThe Popular Choice Award, described below in Section 8, will be determined by public voting. Public voting will take place during the Public Voting Period. The Poster and/or Administrator has the right to extend the Public Voting Period at any time for any reason.\nThe Popular Choice Award winner will be the eligible Submission with the highest number of verified votes received on the Submission\u2019s webpage on the Administrator\u2019s website during the Public Voting Period. Verified vote counts will be determined by the Administrator. If there is a tie between two or more Submissions, the winner will be the Submission with the highest score from the Judges based on the Judging Criteria, and if applicable the Tie Breaker procedure, described above in Section 6.\nPublic voting is open to any person with a verified Devpost account. Each person is limited to one vote per Submission and may only vote using one account. Makers may not directly or indirectly offer or pay any monetary or other form of consideration in exchange for a vote.\nYou many not use any manual or automated vote process or methods, or multiple e-mail addresses, to circumvent the one-vote limit per person per Submission. Doing so will subject all of your votes to disqualification. The Poster and/or Administrator may also disqualify a Maker, if the Maker receives multiple or irregular votes from the same user or users, receives votes in a manner that indicates manual, automated or other vote manipulation, or attempts to compensate voters.\nIf the voting process fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, the Poster has the right to determine the Popular Choice Award winner by using non-suspect votes, or by any other means they deem appropriate. If no alternative means of determining a winner of the Popular Choice Award is available or selected, the Poster may terminate the Popular Choice Award without designating a winner.\nThe Poster and Administrator are not responsible for, and are not required to count any vote which, in their judgment, is incomplete, late, misdirected, damaged, unlawful or illicit.

The Poster will not award a Prize if there are no eligible Submissions entered in the Challenge, or if there are no eligible Makers or Submissions for a specific Prize.\nA monetary Prize will be mailed to the winning Maker\u2019s address (if an individual) or the Representative\u2019s address (if a team or Organization) after receipt of the Required Forms.
