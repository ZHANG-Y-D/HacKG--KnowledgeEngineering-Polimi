Some people go to compete but most people take part to better themselves and have fun. Whatever the reason is you're at a hackathon, make sure you\u2019re making the event better for everyone,\u00a0by collaborating with other teams, helping beginners, and having fun.\n\nAfter hacking finishes, teams will show their projects to each other and to the judges. You are strongly encouraged to present a demo of what you have built. You should present what you have done even if your hack is broken or you weren\u2019t able to finish. It's okay if you didn't finish your hack\u2014that happens all the time! Completion is only one part of the judging criteria, so you might still do well. Also, demoing is not just about the competition. It's a chance to share with others what you learned and what you tried to build\u2014that's what hacking's all about! In the case that you don't have anything to demo, you can give a presentation about what you tried and what you learned. Hearing what other people learned is interesting and inspiring for other attendees.\nTeams will be judged on these four criteria. Judges will weigh the criteria equally. During judging, participants should try to describe what they did for each criterion in their project.\n\u2022 \n\u00a0The project's potential beyond the hackathon: does this project have commercial viability? Projects with the greatest entrepreneurship are not necessarily the projects with the highest potential profitability, but that satisfy consumer needs.\n\u2022 \n\u00a0This incorporates creativity and originality. Projects with high ingenuity should be unique, and solve a problem in a novel and effective way.\n\u2022 \n\u00a0How much did the team do with their time? Projects that score highly should be polished and fully functional.\n\u2022 \n\u00a0Was the presentation thorough and convincing? Well presented projects are compelling and have complete and rehearsed presentations.\n\u2022 \n Was the project of a high technical difficulty? High scoring teams are ambitious in their undertakings.\n\u2022 \n Did the project stand out to you? What was your overall impression?\nThese criteria will guide judges but ultimately judges are free to make decisions based on their gut feeling of which projects are the most impressive and most deserving.\nThe competition is just a part of the hackathon. To make the most out of the event, try something new, teach other people, and make new friends!", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "The prize for the top competing team.", "prize-title": "Grand Prize"}, {"prize-content": "The prize for the second place project.", "prize-title": "First Runner-Up"}, {"prize-content": "The prize for the third place team.", "prize-title": "Second Runner-Up"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=400 Landrum Dr, Williamsburg, VA 23185, USA", "hackathon-url": "https://tribehacks-iv.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": "The project's potential beyond the hackathon: does this project have commercial viability?
