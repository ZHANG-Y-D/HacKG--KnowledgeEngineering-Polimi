These innovators come together and collaborate to build cool things. Entrepreneurs, designers, and developers work in teams to create hacks and apps for web or mobile platforms \u2014 in our case, the creators are university and high school students.\n\u00a0\nHackISU is open to all students (and possibly high school students as well)! You don't have to be a Computer Science major or even an engineering student, though it's best if you have some coding experience. You aren't required to have ever attended a hackathon before. You can come with a team, hack alone, or create a team at HackISU. We'll even help you find other participants to join you.\n\u00a0\nHackISU has great opportunities for people that are new to programming. You can join a team and learn as you go.\n\n\nNo, this hackathon is open to students regardless of where they go to school.\n\u00a0\nTravel reimbursement information will be available soon.\n\u00a0\nYou need to apply to HackISU. You're at the right place! Simply click on the \"Register\" button at the top of this page\u00a0once it becomes available (coming soon!).\n\u00a0\nFor starters, bring your laptop and charger. Bring your cell phone and charger too, and a power splitter if you have one! \u00a0In addition, bringing a water bottle, pillow, and any other accessories you would bring to a sleepover would be a good idea.\n\u00a0\nThere can be up to four people.\n\u00a0\nNope! We will have sessions to help people find team members, as well as an idea generation workshop to help people think of ideas to work on for the hackathon. So you should sign up regardless!\n\nNo,\u00a0but\u00a0all your coding and work must be done at the site of the competition.\n\u00a0\nYes. The only thing you need to worry about is coding; let us take care of the rest. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and plenty of drinks will be provided throughout the competition at no cost to participants. We will be providing vegetarian options as well. If you have a specific food allergy, be sure to specify in the application.\n\u00a0\nNo, contestants are not allowed to work on their apps before the 36-hour period. If you want to prepare for the hackathon, focus on gaining experience with and knowledge of the tools you hope to use to build your project.\n\u00a0\nTeams will demo their application to a panel of judges, who will deliberate on their favorite submissions to choose the winners.\n\u00a0\nDemos will take place at 9:00 AM on Sunday.\n\u00a0\nAdditional questions?
