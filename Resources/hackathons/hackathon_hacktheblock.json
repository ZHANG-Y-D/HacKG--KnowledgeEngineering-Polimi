Submissions entered into the former category shall be judged in accordance with the criteria at Section 6A above and those Submissions shall be ranked according to the score awarded to them by the Judges. The four highest-ranking Submissions in this category shall be named as potential prize winners: highest-ranking Submission - the winner of the Grand Prize; second highest-ranking Submission - the winner of 1st Runner Up; third highest-ranking Submission - winner of 2nd Runner Up; and fourth highest-ranking Submission - winner of 3rd Runner Up. Submissions entered into the latter category (the Large Organizations category) shall be judged in accordance with the criteria at section 6A and ranked according to the score awarded to them by the Judges. The highest-ranking Submission in this category shall be selected as the potential winner of the Large Organization Recognition Award.\nFor each Prize listed in Section 7 below (with the exception of the Popular Choice Award), if two or more Submissions are tied, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first applicable criterion listed above will be considered the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions\u2019 scores on the next applicable criterion in the list above. If two or more Submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Submissions and the Submission receiving the most votes will be considered to be the higher scoring Submission.\nIn addition to the above, all eligible Submissions, with the exception of Submissions submitted by Large Organizations, will be evaluated by members of the public to determine which Submission is eligible to receive the Popular Choice Award. A Submission is eligible to win both a Popular Choice Award and one of the \u201cBest Overall App\u201d prizes.\nDuring the Voting Period, all eligible Submissions (excluding Submissions from Large Organizations) will be posted to the Challenge Website consistent with the license provisions outlined in Section 5 above. Public voting is open to any person who is the age of majority in the geographical region they reside and has a verified ChallengePost account. Members of the public may vote on a Submission by logging in to their ChallengePost account, locating a Submission at http:// HackTheBlock.ChallengePost.com/Submissions, clicking on a Submission image, and then clicking on the \u201cVote for this submission\u201d button on the Submission web page. The Submission with the highest number of votes at the end of the Voting Period will be selected as the potential winner of the Popular Choice Award. Makers can review the voting process at http://help.challengepost.com/Public-voting.html. Makers are prohibited from obtaining votes by any fraudulent or inappropriate means, including, without limitation, offering prizes or other inducements to prospective voters, as determined by Poster in its sole discretion. Use of script, macro or any automated system to vote or with the intent to impair the integrity of the voting process is prohibited and all such votes will be void. Poster reserves the right, in its sole and unfettered discretion, to nullify all votes obtained via such means and to disqualify responsible Makers from further voting or participation in the Challenge. Makers may not directly or indirectly offer or pay any monetary or other form of consideration in exchange for a vote.\nEach person is limited to one vote per Submission and may only vote using one ChallengePost account.

Winning a prize is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements set forth herein. If a potential winner does not respond within 72 hours after the first attempt after notification of winning status, that potential winner will be deemed to have forfeited the prize, and the Submission with the next highest number of points or votes (as applicable) for that particular prize will be selected as an alternate potential winner in his/her place. If no Maker claims a prize, Poster will select an alternate potential winner at random from all eligible entries received for that prize, subject to any limitations set forth in these Official Rules. Any alternate potential winner will also have 72 hours to claim the prize, and must satisfy all eligibility requirements.

If a winner fails to respond within 72 hours, fails to sign and return the Affidavit of Eligibility, Liability & Publicity Release within the required time period (if applicable), or in the event that a potential winner is disqualified for any reason, the potential winner will be deemed to have forfeited the prize, and an alternate potential winner shall be named in accordance with these Official Rules. Noncompliance with the foregoing, failure to abide by these Official Rules, or return of the prize notification as non-deliverable may result in disqualification and naming of an alternate potential winner. Only three (3) alternate winner selections from each prize category will be made for each prize, after which any remaining prizes will remain un-awarded.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPrizes cannot be substituted, assigned, or transferred; however, the Poster has the right to make a prize substitution of equivalent or greater value at its sole discretion.
