If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).\nParticipants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.\nAs this is a hackathon, we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our hackathon are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.\nSponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.\nIf you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of hackathon staff immediately.\nHackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.\nIf a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organisers may take any action they deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the hackathon with no refund (if applicable), or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.\nWe expect participants to follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues and hackathon-related social events.", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "Overall favorite hack.", "prize-title": "Overall Best Hack"}, {"prize-content": "Web app that stands out of the crowd.", "prize-title": "Best Web Hack"}, {"prize-content": "Hack that best utilizes physical hardware.", "prize-title": "Best Hardware"}, {"prize-content": "Awards hack that contributes to society.", "prize-title": "Most Socially Aware"}, {"prize-content": "Best hack from a new hacker.", "prize-title": "Best Novice"}, {"prize-content": "Mobile app with an impact.", "prize-title": "Best Mobile Hack"}, {"prize-content": "Hack that is functional and aesthetic.", "prize-title": "Most Creative"}, {"prize-content": "Most technically difficult to implement.", "prize-title": "Most Technical"}, {"prize-content": "Everyone has the right to know what is in their water.
