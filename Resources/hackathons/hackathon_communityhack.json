These are guidelines for making expected behavior more well-defined. Few people set out to be jerks or annoy others, so these social rules help us all to avoid behaviors harmful to a supportive, productive, and fun learning environment.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow to Reach Us: Members of the CommunityHack team will be available via voice or text. You can find those on the PDF of CommunityHack team.\nIf any attendee engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organizers may take any lawful action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to warning the offender or asking the offender to leave the hackathon. (If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating this code of conduct, you should contact the CommunityHack team with a concise description of your grievance; any grievances filed will be considered by the entire CommunityHack team.)\n We welcome your feedback on this and every other aspect of CommunityHack, and we thank you for working with us to make it a safe, enjoyable, and friendly experience for everyone who participates.\n Thank you.\n", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Best Elevator Pitch"}, {"prize-content": "Max 4 winners", "prize-title": "Most Helpful Hack"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Most Learned for a Hack Hacker"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Most Entertaining Hack"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Most Complete Hack"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=124 Raymond Ave, Poughkeepsie, NY 12603, USA", "hackathon-url": "https://communityhack.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": "Given to the project that is the most enjoyable to learn about"}, {"judging-criterion": "Given to the project that has the most potential to help the hackers' choice of community"}, {"judging-criterion": "Given to the hacker who came in with minimal experience and learned a bunch! \n\nKudos for giving coding a try!
