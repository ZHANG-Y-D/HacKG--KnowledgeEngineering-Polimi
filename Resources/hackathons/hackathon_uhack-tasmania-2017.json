It will be a good idea to familiarise yourself ahead of UHack Tasmania with DevPost projects, the submission process, preparing YouTube videos and Google Docs.\nThe main deliverable that you will be judged using will be your 3-Minute Pitch Video. During your video you'll summarise your Business Model Canvas and demo your app. You'll need to shoot and edit your video using your own equipment \u2013 laptop and phone camera quality will be fine. You'll need to upload your video to YouTube (or similar) for our judges to view, and link to it from your DevPost project page.\nSee the\u00a0", "hackathon-rules": "\nOur hackathon is dedicated to providing an empowering, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, previous hackathon attendance or computing experience (or lack of any of the aforementioned).\nWe do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any hackathon venue, including hacks, talks, workshops, parties, social media and other online media. Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon without a refund (if applicable) at the discretion of the hackathon organisers.\nWhilst the event will be an opportunity to apply what you've learnt from browsing APIs, datasets or websites prior to the event, the event will be relying on you commencing work on you project\u00a0only from the Friday evening. The only exception to this rule is if it's been made Open Source, freely available for use by other teams and in the public-domain.\nPrior to the event, feel free to fill your boots with learning about relevant University research, themes, etc., all of which will help you once the event kicks off and perhaps give you the edge you need.
