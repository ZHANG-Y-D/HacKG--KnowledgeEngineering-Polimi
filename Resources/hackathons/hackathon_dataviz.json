Participation constitutes Contestant's full and unconditional agreement to these Official Rules and administrative decisions, which are final and binding in all matters related to the Challenge. Eligibility for a prize award is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements set forth herein.\n\u00a0\n\nThe Challenge Submission Period begins on July 29, 2011, at 12:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) and ends on October 31, 2011, at 11:59 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST).\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere are two basic steps for entry:\nAn entry into the Challenge consists of your data visualization piece and accompanying summary to the U.S DOT (together, the \u201cEntry Materials\u201d). All Entry Materials must be in English. All requested information must be provided for your entry to be valid.\nSubmissions may be updated by the submitter until the Challenge Submission Period ends.\n\nUsing data sets including those provided by the U.S. DOT, create a data visualization product that addresses critical transportation policy or investment questions related to transportation safety or economic development.\n\nImproving safety throughout the transportation network is the premier goal of the Department of Transportation. Safety measures include rates of transportation-related deaths and transportation-related injuries.\u00a0 Many factors may influence these rates.\u00a0 For example:\nIn 2005, 43,510 people were killed on our nation\u2019s roadways at a rate of 1.46 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled.\u00a0 In 2009, the number of people killed fell to 33,808 at a rate of 1.13 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled in 2009.\u00a0 There are many theories to explain the source of the improvement including:\u00a0 the effects of the economic downturn; manufacturers creating safer vehicles; success of safety campaigns such as those against drunk driving and distracted driving; higher rates of seatbelt use; and engineering improvements to roads and highways.\u00a0\nA sample visualization topic could be to examine through data visualization, the impacts of one or more of the above sources on improving the safety measure of rates of fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled between 2005 and 2009.\u00a0\nThe data visualization topic could also focus on local issues.\u00a0 For example, drawing from local data sources, how have improvements on an intersection, corridor or bus route helped to improve safety?\u00a0 If no improvements have yet to be made, can the safety incident data be presented in a way that points to what countermeasures can be taken to improve safety?\u00a0\n\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) database: \n.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 U.S. Census database: \n.\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 State and local department of transportation data: Talk to your local DOT!\n4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other data sources as you see fit.\n5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reduction in transportation-related deaths\n6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reduction in transportation-related injuries\n\nThe competition for transportation development dollars is fierce.\u00a0 It is important for decision makers to know that their investment decisions will lead to positive outcomes for desired targets, be it safety, mobility/livability, security or economic growth.\u00a0\nThe impact of transportation delays on economic growth has been well documented.\u00a0 In April 2011 a new rule went into effect aimed at curbing the practice of airlines holding passengers on the tarmac for long periods while awaiting gates or runways.\u00a0 Since that rule went into effect, the number of incidents of excessive tarmac time has dropped.\u00a0 A possible side effect of the rule has been an increase in flight cancellations, resulting in individuals potentially being delayed further.\u00a0\nAn investment example of possible unintended consequences of decisions is the case where a new runway added at a 4 runway airport may be anticipated to add 25 percent to the overall airport capacity, but due to added operational complexity, a lower level of capacity is achieved.\nThere is a broad range of aviation data available for application to data visualization.\u00a0 In addition to the above examples, sample topics could include:\n\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Bureau of Transportation Statistics\u2019 airline information:\u00a0 \n.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FAA data source?\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis\u2019 economics account data: \n.\n4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other data sources as you see fit.\n\u00a0\n\nChallenge submissions will be scored in each of four criteria, as listed below.\n\nLike artwork, data visualization products should be designed to capture the attention of the reader through creative use of visuals, layout, and animations (if applicable).\u00a0 How original and attractive is the data visualization product?\n\nAt the core of data visualization is its potential to synthesize multiple, large datasets to deliver relevant and actionable information to the reader in a visually compelling way.\u00a0 How well does the data visualization product accomplish this?\n\nDoes the author\u2019s submission contribute to a potential policy or investment issue in transportation safety or economic development?\n\nDoes the information presented in the data visualization product and summary shed new light on a transportation issue that otherwise would not have been seen?\nThe data visualization product submissions will judged by a qualified panel of BTS stakeholders selected by the U.S. DOT at its sole discretion. The panel will judge the entire submission (data visualization product and summary text) on the judging criteria identified above in order to select the awardees. Judges have the right to withdraw without advance notice in the event of circumstances beyond their control.\n\u00a0\n\n\nPotential winners must continue to comply with all terms and conditions of these Official Rules, and winning is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements. The potential winners will be notified by email, telephone, or mail after the date of the judging. The potential winners will be required to sign and return to U.S. DOT, within ten (10) days of the date notice is sent, an Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability/Publicity Release (except where prohibited) in order to claim any recognition. In the event that a potential winner of a Challenge recognition is disqualified for any reason, U.S. DOT may award the applicable recognition to an alternate winner who had the highest score remaining of the eligible entries.\n\u00a0\n\nTwo grand prizes will be awarded. Depending on the number of Submissions, the U.S. DOT may also recognize several submissions through the U.S. DOT Research and Innovative Technology Administration website.\nFollowing the announcement of the award, the grand prize awardees will be honored at the Transportation Research Board\u2019s (TRB) 91st Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C., which lasts from January 22-26, 2012.\u00a0 Authorized travel expenses will be paid for up to one member of each team awarded the grand prize to attend the conference in its entirety and present their work. These expenses include the TRB Annual Meeting registration fee, transportation, meals and lodging.\u00a0If a winning team consists of more than one individual, the team must designate the individual who will represent the team at TRB. Travelers will need to provide receipts to document travel expenses and the travel expenses will be reimbursed according to Federal Government travel rules and regulations, including 41 CFR 300-3.1 (Invitational Travel).\u00a0 Maximum reimbursement rates for travel to Washington, D.C. are published by the General Services Administration here (\n); these limits apply to the awards made in this Challenge.\u00a0 No air travel with origins or destinations outside the U.S. (including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa) will be purchased, reimbursed or otherwise covered through the awards made in this Challenge. No cash equivalent or substitute compensation will be made in place of the authorized travel expenses.\nIn addition, each of the two grand prize winning teams will be awarded a $2,000 (US) education scholarship by BTS.\u00a0 If a winning team consists of more than one individual, the team must designate the individual who will receive the scholarship.\u00a0 Upon receiving the scholarship, the team may choose to divide the award at its own discretion.\nThe submitting individual may designate, within 10 business days following notification of award, other persons to whom to redirect the award.\n\u00a0\n\nEach Contestant grants to the U.S. DOT and others acting on behalf of the U.S. DOT, a royalty-free non-exclusive worldwide license to use, copy for use, perform publicly, and display publicly all parts of the Submission for the purposes of the Challenge. This license includes posting or linking to the Submission on the official U.S. DOT website and making it available for use by the public.\n\u00a0\n\nBy entering, each Contestant agrees to: (a) comply with and be bound by these Official Rules and the decisions of the U.S. DOT and/or the Challenge judges which are binding and final in all matters relating to this Challenge; (b) release and hold harmless the U.S. DOT and any other organizations responsible for sponsoring, fulfilling, administering, advertising or promoting the Challenge, and all of their respective past and present officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the \"Released Parties\") from and against any and all claims, expenses, and liability, including but not limited to negligence and damages of any kind to persons and property, including but not limited to invasion of privacy (under appropriation, intrusion, public disclosure of private facts, false light in the public eye or other legal theory), defamation, slander, libel, violation of right of publicity, infringement of trademark, copyright or other intellectual property rights, property damage, or death or personal injury arising out of or relating to a Contestant\u2019s entry, creation of an entry or submission of an entry, participation in the Challenge, acceptance or use or misuse of prize (including any travel or activity related thereto) and/or the broadcast, transmission, performance, exploitation or use of entry; and (c) indemnify, defend and hold harmless the U.S. DOT against any and all claims, expenses, and liabilities (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of or relating to a Contestant's participation in the Challenge and/or Contestant's acceptance, use or misuse of a prize or recognition.\n\u00a0\n\nExcept where prohibited, participation in the Challenge constitutes Contestant\u2019s consent to U.S. DOT's and its agents' use of Contestant\u2019s name, likeness, photograph, voice, opinions, and/or hometown and state for promotional purposes in any media, worldwide, without further payment or consideration.\n\u00a0\n\nThe U.S. DOT reserves the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify the Challenge, or any part of it, if any fraud, technical failures or any other factor beyond the U.S. DOT\u2019s reasonable control impairs the integrity or proper functioning of the Challenge, as determined by the U.S. DOT in its sole discretion.
