Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to an of the criteria mentioned above, the use of sexual language or images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, disruption of work or presentations, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. \u00a0The projects created at our hackathon are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.\nPhotography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If a participant objects to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (for example, in bathrooms).\nIf you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the ScriptEd team immediately. \u00a0If a participant engages in harassing behavior, we will take any action we deem appropriate.
