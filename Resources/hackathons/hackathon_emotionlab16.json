Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any hackathon venue, including hacks, talks, workshops, parties, social media and other online media.\nPhotography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).\nThe event organizers will enforce this code of conduct throughout the event. \u00a0If a participant violates the code of conduct, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the hackathon with no refund, or reporting their behavior to local law enforcement.\nIf you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Paula David or another member of the hackathon staff immediately.\nPaula David - cell: 617 899 1651 or email: paula.david@affectiva.com\n\nThese Emotion Lab Hackathon Rules \u00a0(these \u201cRules\u201d) govern the Emotion Lab Hackathon (the \u201cHackathon\u201d). \u00a0This Hackathon is sponsored by Affectiva, Inc.

There's no need to break Don\u2019t Repeat Yourself (DRY) rules when there are so many great resources available to all Hackers.
