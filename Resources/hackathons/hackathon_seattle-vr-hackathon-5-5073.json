Further rules changes may occur throughout the weekend in response to questions and emerging issues. Such changes will be announced if and when they occur.\nThe following rules have been set at this time:\nIn a change from previous events, we will allocate work spaces to teams on Friday night. Teams will no longer be able to claim spaces in a free-for-all as they have previously. We will be looking into pipe & drape dividers to help divide the main room and prevent interference between equipment.\nWe, the Seattle VR Hackathon Organizers, are committed to making the VR Hackathon a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or technical expertise (or lack of any of the aforementioned).\nWe will not tolerate harassment of any kind. Harassment may include verbal abuse, sexually explicit or derogatory language, offensive or sexual cartoons or materials, mimicry, offensive gestures, unwelcome sexual advances, and telling of jokes offensive to others in the community. In general, sexual advances of any kind are considered unwelcome by default and are not appropriate at this event.\nDrugs and alcohol are not permitted on site. Individuals who appear intoxicated or otherwise under the influence of drugs or alcohol will be asked to leave the event until they have recovered.\nIf, in the eyes of the Organizers, a hackathon participant is seen to have violated these rules, they may be warned, sanctioned, or asked to leave the hackathon without a refund (if applicable). In other words, just do the following: be aware of your actions and their effects on others; don\u2019t treat the hackathon like a dating sim; and, in general, be nice to one another.", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Passenger Experience for Air Travellers"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Best of Show"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Best Visual Design"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Best Use of Sound"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Best Technical Achievement"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Best Interaction Design"}, {"prize-content": "Awarded in place of Best Use of Narrative", "prize-title": "Prize for Novelty"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=Building 5, 7543 63rd Ave NE, Seattle, WA 98115, USA", "hackathon-url": "https://seattle-vr-hackathon-5-5073.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}], "hackathon-location-address": "Building 5, 7543 63rd Ave NE, Seattle, WA 98115, USA", "hackathon-description-header": "Come join us for a weekend of creativity, innovation, and learning with VR and other immersive technologies!", "hackathon-prizes-total": "$2,700", "hackathon-location-description": "University of Washington", "hackathon-end-date": "2017-04-23", "has-projects": "True"}
