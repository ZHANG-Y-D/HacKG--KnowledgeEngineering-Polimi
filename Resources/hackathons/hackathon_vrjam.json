Eligible participants must then determine whether they will participate in this Contest as an Individual, a Team, or an Organization (each term is defined below). Once determined, the eligible Individual, Team, or Organization may enter this Contest by visiting the Contest Site during the Submission Period and completing the multi-stage entry process detailed below, which requires the Entrant (defined below) to create, develop, and submit a Software program. Registration will open at the beginning of the Contest Period. To be eligible, participants must register at the Contest Site sometime between the beginning of the Contest Period and the Milestone 1 Deadline. Then, Entrants will be required to submit different content by four (4) deadlines starting at the beginning and continuing throughout the Submission Period. If you register prior to the beginning of the Submission Period you may, if desired, use this time to meet and coordinate with potential Team members (if any) through the Contest Site. Due to the inherent functionality of the Contest Site, the Contest Site allows visitors to continue to register throughout the Contest Period, but those who register after the Milestone 1 Deadline are not eligible to participate in or win this Contest.\nEligible entries received in accordance with these Terms will be subject to a two-stage evaluation process. First, all eligible entries received in this Contest will be reviewed and evaluated by a panel of Sponsor-selected Judges (defined below). For this first stage of the evaluation process, the Judges will confine their review to the Software Description, Progress Image, and Progress Video submitted by each Entrant (all terms defined below) and will perform only a cursory review of the Entrant\u2019s Software to confirm that it functions as described. Based on this initial review, the first panel of Judges will select a minimum of fifty (50) total \u201cFinalists\u201d (as defined and described in more detail below). Those Finalists will then be evaluated by a second panel of Sponsor-selected Judges, who will select twenty-six (26) total winners in accordance with the judging procedures detailed under the \u201cWinner Selection\u201d section below: seventeen (17) winners from the Game Track and nine (9) winners from the Application/Experience Track (both terms defined and described below). Winners from the Game Track will be as follows: one (1) Platinum prize winner, two (2) Gold prize winners, four (4) Silver prize winners, and ten (10) Bronze prize winners. Winners from the Application/Experience Track will be as follows: one (1) Platinum prize winner, two (2) Gold prize winners, two (2) Silver prize winners, and four (4) Bronze prize winners. In addition, eligible entries will be subject to a popular vote by users of the Contest Site during the Public Voting Period (defined below), as more fully described below. Following the conclusion of the Public Voting Period, the one (1) entry from the Game Track that received the most eligible, non-suspect votes will, subject to verification, be declared the Community\u2019s Choice Game winner and the one (1) entry from the Application/Experience Track that received the most eligible, non-suspect votes will, subject to verification, be declared the Community\u2019s Choice App or Experience winner.\n\n: For the purposes of this Contest, the \u201c\n\u201d means the United States, Canada (excluding Quebec), United Kingdom, Germany, France, Sweden, Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Switzerland, Norway, Poland, Austria, Belgium, Russia, Thailand, Singapore, India, Mexico and Japan.

However, Entrant need not submit each component as a separate submission if more than one component is completed prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, while a completed Software & Entrant Overview, Progress Image, and Progress Video must be timely submitted in accordance with the schedule described above in order for Entrant to remain eligible in this Contest, they need not be finalized until the end of the Submission Period. Entrants may update or change their Software & Entrant Overview, Progress Image, and Progress Video at any time prior to the end of the Submission Period, including to provide an updated description or view of the Software as it develops or \u2013 if Entrant\u2019s direction changes \u2013 to describe a new Software program entirely, provided that each of the above-described deadlines is met on time and that, at the end of the Submission Period, the Software & Entrant Overview, Progress Image, and Progress Video all describe or depict the Software ultimately submitted by Entrant. This includes the ability to move between the Game Track and the Application/Experience Track at any time prior to the end of the Submission Period. The only aspects of an Entrant\u2019s Entry that cannot be changed during the course of the Entry process are (i) the identity of (and information regarding) the Entrant itself (including, for a Team Entrant, the members of that Team) and (ii) if selected, the Engine. After the Milestone 1 Deadline, the identity of an Entrant and composition of a Team Entrant and any Engine designated may not be changed.\nAn Entrant may submit as many Entries as he/she/it would like, provided that each Entry must be based on a different Software program. No Entrant(s) may submit more than one (1) Entry for a single Software program. Entries must be submitted and received by Sponsor during the Submission Period through the Contest Site in strict accordance with these Terms. The database clock for the Contest Site will be the official timekeeper for this Contest. For purposes of this Contest, only complete Entries that are actually received by Sponsor through the Contest Site and during the Submission Period will be considered. Other proof of submitting or attempting to submit an Entry (such as, without limitation, a screenshot or an automated email confirmation message from Sponsor) does not constitute proof of actual receipt of the Entry for purposes of this Contest. Those who do not abide by these Terms and the instructions of Sponsor and provide all required Entrant Content may, in Sponsor\u2019s sole discretion, be disqualified. Entries or participation may not be acknowledged and will not be returned. Entries (or participation that does not qualify as an \u201cEntry\u201d) that are incomplete, lost, late, misdirected, mutilated, fraudulent, illegitimate, incomprehensible, garbled, or generated by a macro, bot, or other automated means will not be accepted and will be void. Entries or participation made on behalf of an Entrant by a third party not affiliated or associated with that Entrant (as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion) or originating through any commercial promotion subscription, notification, or entering service will be declared invalid and disqualified for this Contest. No Released Party (defined below) will have any responsibility or liability for any dispute regarding any Entrant, including the identity of any Individual Entrant, the composition or members of a Team or Organization Entrant, or the distribution of any prize won among members of a Team or Organization Entrant. In the event that any dispute regarding an Entry or Entrant (including those regarding the identity or members of an Entrant Team/Organization or any Entrant\u2019s rights in the applicable Software) cannot be resolved to Sponsor\u2019s satisfaction, the Entry will be deemed ineligible and the Entrant disqualified. Sponsor will collect and process Entrants' personal information and it will be shared with Sponsor's partners, agents and affiliates to the extent necessary to conduct the Contest, including for prizes to be delivered to the winners. The collection and storage of winners' personal information will be in accordance with Sponsor's applicable privacy policy in place from time to time (a copy of which can be found at www.oculus.com/privacy). Without limiting the foregoing and where applicable, Sponsor may provide the email address(es) of any Entrant to prize provider Unity Technologies ApS and its affiliates (\u201c\n\u201d) or any of the Contest Entities for the purposes of supplying prizes in this Contest. As a condition of entering the Contest, without limiting any other provision in these Terms, each Entrant gives consent for Sponsor and its agents to obtain and deliver his/her/its name, email or mailing address, and other information and Entry to third parties for the purpose of administering this Contest and complying with applicable laws, regulations, and rules. ENTRIES WILL NOT BE RETURNED AND, IN FACT, MAY BE DESTROYED. KEEP A COPY OR THE ORIGINAL OF EACH ELEMENT OF THE ENTRY. ANY ENTRY THAT DOES NOT CONFORM TO THE REQUIREMENTS IN THESE TERMS MAY, IN SPONSOR\u2019S SOLE DISCRETION, BE DEEMED INELIGIBLE.\n\u00a0\n\nEntrant Content must meet all of the following requirements, as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion, or the associated Entry may be disqualified:\n\u00a0\nSponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify from the Contest any Entrant (and all natural persons comprising such Entrant) whose Entry (in its sole discretion) refers, depicts, or in any way reflects negatively upon a Contest Entity, the Contest, or any other person or entity or does not comply with these Terms, including any of the above Submission Requirements.\n\u00a0\n\n(a) \n. Eligible Entries received during the Submission Period will be evaluated through a two-stage process as follows:\nFirst, all eligible Entries received in this Contest will be reviewed and evaluated by a panel of judges selected by Sponsor in its sole discretion (\u201c\n\u201d). For this first stage of the evaluation process, the Judges will primarily confine their review to the Software Description, Progress Image, and Progress Video submitted by each Entrant. The Judges will review those portions of each eligible Entry based on the following evenly weighted criteria (collectively the \u201c\n\u201d):\n(i) Promise. Extent to which the Judge believes that Entrant\u2019s concept for its Software will, if well executed, appeal to the greater Oculus community; and\n(ii) Innovation. Extent to which the Software Description, Progress Image, and Progress Video demonstrate originality in design of the Software. This Criterion considers the design and execution of the Software\u2019s user interface and other elements evidenced in the Entrant Content reviewed. Where applicable, the Judges may also take into account any innovative use of virtual-reality mechanics by Entrant\u2019s Software that is described or observable in the Entrant Content reviewed. Examples of \u201cvirtual-reality mechanics\u201d considered under this Criterion include (but are not limited to) multi-user capabilities, head-tracking, and touch-pad use.\nIn the first round of the judging process, the Judges will also perform a cursory review of the Entrant\u2019s Software primarily to confirm that the Software will function as described in the selected materials. In the event that the Judges are unable to get an Entrant\u2019s Software to function after reasonable efforts, that Entrant may be disqualified. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the Judges may (in either round of the judging process) contact Entrant to request a bug fix or other minor modification to the Software to address a functionality or stability issue (any a \u201c\n\u201d) or implement any Big Fix provided by Entrant after the Submission Period and may, in judging an Entry, consider the Software as modified by any such Bug Fix. However, the decision to request or implement any Bug Fix is within Sponsor\u2019s sole discretion. Sponsor will be under no obligation to request a Bug Fix or implement any Bug Fix provided and may disqualify any Entrant whose Software is not completely functional when submitted in this Contest.\nFor each First-Round Criterion, each eligible Entry will be scored on a scale of one (1) to five (5) by each Judge. The Entries that, based on their score from the first round of judging, are in the top twenty percent (20%) of all eligible Entries received for the Games Track will be selected as potential \u201c\n\u201d The Entries that, based on their score from the first round of judging, are in the top twenty percent (20%) of all eligible Entries received for the Application/Experience Track will be selected as potential \u201c\n\u201d The Game Finalists and Application/Experience Finalists are collectively referred to herein as the \u201c\n.\u201d There will be a minimum of thirty (30) Game Finalists and twenty (20) Application/Experience Finalists (provided that Sponsor has received enough eligible Entries in this Contest to meet such minimums) and Sponsor may appoint Finalists whose score after the first round of judging is lower than the required percentile in order to satisfy these minimums. In the event of a tie in the determination of any Finalist, all Entries that share the tying score will advance to the second round of the judging process.\nThe Finalists will then be judged by a second panel of Judges (including at least one independent judge) chosen by Sponsor in its sole discretion based on the following evenly weighted criteria: (i) the overall virtual-reality experience of the Software (including how fun, useful, and engaging the Judge considers the Finalist\u2019s Software) and (ii) the innovation in virtual-reality mechanics demonstrated by the Software (the \u201c\n\u201d). Examples of \u201cvirtual-reality mechanics\u201d considered under the latter Second-Round Criterion include (but are not limited to) multi-user capabilities, head-tracking, touch-pad use, and the user interface. In the second stage of the judging process, the Judges will apply the Criteria to the Entry based primarily on the Software itself. However, the Judges may also look to the Software Description, Progress Image, and Progress Video for additional information regarding the Entry.\nFor each Second-Round Criterion, each eligible Entry will be scored on a scale of one (1) to five (5) by each Judge. (All Finalists will be re-evaluated by the Judges in the second stage of the judging process and the scores for each Finalist from the first round of the judging process will not carry forward, except where necessary to break a tie as described below.) Of the Game Finalists, the seventeen (17) Entries with the seventeen (17) highest scores after application of the Second-Round Criteria will be selected as the potential winners of the one (1) Platinum prize, two (2) Gold prizes, four (4) Silver prizes, and ten (10) Bronze prizes, respectively. Of the Application/Experience Finalists, the nine (9) Entries with the nine (9) highest scores after application of the Second-Round Criteria will be selected as the potential winners of the one (1) Platinum prize, two (2) Gold prizes, two (2) Silver prizes, and four (4) Bronze prizes, respectively. In the event of a tie in the selection of any potential Winner, the tie will be resolved in favor of the Entry with the higher score on \u201coverall virtual-reality experience\u201d Second-Round Criterion. If the tie persists, it will be resolved in favor of the Entry with the higher score on the \u201cvirtual-reality mechanics\u201d Second-Round Criterion. If the tie still persists, it will be resolved in favor of the Entry that received the higher score on the \u201cpromise\u201d First-Round Criterion. Finally, if the tie still persists, it will be resolved in favor of the Entry that received the higher score on the \u201cinnovation\u201d First-Round Criterion.\n(b) \n. For purposes of this Contest, the \u201c\n\u201d will begin at 12:00:00 a.m. PT on May 12, 2015 (7:00:00 a.m. UTC/9:00 a.m. CEST on May 12, 2015) and will close at 11:59:59 p.m. PT on May 26, 2015 (6:59:59 a.m. UTC/8:59:59 a.m. CEST on May 27, 2015). During the Public Voting Period, Entries submitted in this Contest will be available for review by visitors to the Contest Site, including the ability for visitors to download and use the Software, as described above. Visitors to the Contest Site will be directed to review Entries and invited to register with ChallengePost and vote for the best Entries by applying the Second-Round Criteria. Only registered users of ChallengePost\u2019s service may use the ChallengePost Public Voting tool to vote for Entries. A registered ChallengePost user may vote for each Entry only once and must comply with all of ChallengePost\u2019s terms and policies in order for his or her vote to count. Following the close of the Public Voting Period, the one (1) eligible Entry from the Games Track with the most eligible, non-suspect votes will be identified as the potential Community\u2019s Choice Game winner and the one (1) eligible Entry from the Application/Experience Track with the most eligible, non-suspect votes will be identified as the potential Community\u2019s Choice App or Experience winner (collectively, the potential \u201c\n\u201d).\nEntrants are prohibited from offering inducement in connection with votes or obtaining votes by any fraudulent or inappropriate means, as determined by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, including, without limitation, by offering prizes or other incentives or inducements in exchange for votes or by registering multiple ChallengePost user accounts (or encouraging others to do so) in order to submit votes in excess of the above-stated limit. Use of these techniques, or of any script, macro, or other automated or artificial system to vote, or acting in any manner with the intent or effect of impairing the integrity of the voting process, is prohibited and all such votes will, upon discovery by the Sponsor, be deemed null and void and may lead to the disqualification of the applicable Entrant. Sponsor reserves the right to restrict or void votes from any device, ChallengePost account, IP address, or other identifiable source or for any Entrant if any vote is determined or suspected to be fraudulent or otherwise in violation of these Terms, as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion. Without limiting any other provision of these Terms, if the voting process is incapable of operating as planned for any reason (including, without limitation, Sponsor\u2019s determination or suspicion of voting fraud or any other action that Sponsor determines has impaired or undermined the administration, security, fairness, or proper conduct of the voting process), Sponsor reserves the right to determine the potential Community\u2019s Choice winners (i) by counting only non-suspect votes or only those votes made by a select group of non-suspect users chosen by Sponsor in its sole discretion or (ii) as otherwise determined to be fair by Sponsor in its sole discretion.\nAN ENTRANT MAY WIN A MAXIMUM OF FIVE (5) PRIZES IN THIS CONTEST, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES SUBMITTED BY THAT ENTRANT. Sponsor reserves the right to contact Entrants for verification purposes and administration of the Contest. All Judges\u2019 decisions are final and binding in all matters relating to this Contest. Each Entrant acknowledges that other Entrants may have created ideas and concepts contained in their Entry that may have familiarities or similarities to his/her/its Entry (including, without limitation, a similar Software program), and that he/she/it will not be entitled to any compensation or right to negotiate with the Contest Entities because of these familiarities or similarities.\nSponsor or its designee will announce the \u201cFinalists\u201d on the Contest Site on or around May 18, 2015. Sponsor or its designee will attempt to notify the potential winners by telephone or email (as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion) on or around May 27, 2015. Sponsor will announce the potential winners on the Contest Site on or around June 3, 2015. (All dates and times as measured in the US Pacific Time Zone.) Each potential winner (including each individual member of any Team winner) may be required to complete, execute, have notarized (if applicable), and return an Affidavit/Declaration of Eligibility and Liability/Publicity Release (unless prohibited by law), tax documents, an agreement regarding distribution of the Software through Sponsor\u2019s Oculus Store (as described below), and related prize-acceptance documents (collectively, \u201c\n\u201d) within the time frame specified and in the form provided by Sponsor, without revision, or prize may be forfeited. The Prizewinner Documents, if applicable, must be received by Sponsor from the potential winner (including each individual member of any Team winner) within five (5) days of Sponsor sending the documents to the potential winner (or other time frame as stated in the Prizewinner Documents) or prize may be forfeited and an alternate winner selected. If any notification or other Contest-related communication is returned as undeliverable, or if a selected potential winner cannot be reached or does not respond as instructed after Sponsor has attempted to notify that potential winner, that selected potential winner may be disqualified and an alternate winner may be selected (time permitting and in Sponsor\u2019s sole discretion).

Sponsor is not responsible for any inability or unwillingness of any winning Entrant to accept or use the prize (or portion thereof) for any reason. Prize elements delivered by mail will only be mailed to the winning Entrant\u2019s address within the Territory. Prize details not specifically stated in these Terms, (including the form or method of any payment) will be determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion. All taxes (including, without limitation, national, federal, state, provincial, territorial, prefectural, and/or local taxes), as well as any expenses arising from acceptance or use of the prize and not specified in these Terms as being provided as part of the prize, are the sole responsibility of the prizewinner. Sponsor is not responsible for and will not replace any lost, mutilated or stolen prize or prize element or any prize that is undeliverable or does not reach a prizewinner because of incorrect or changed contact or bank routing information. If a prizewinner does not accept or use the entire prize for any reason, the unaccepted or unused part of the prize will be forfeited and Sponsor will have no further obligation with respect to that prize or portion of the prize. No transfers will be made. Sponsor reserves the right to substitute any stated prize or any component thereof with another prize or component of equal or greater value in case that the prize is not available for unexpected reasons. No more than the stated prizes will be awarded. Entrants waive the right to assert as a cost of winning any prize, any and all costs of verification and redemption and any liability and publicity which might arise from claiming or seeking to claim said prize. No Released Party (defined below) will have any responsibility for division of prizes among natural persons comprising any prizewinning Entrant that is a Team or Organization or any liability to any natural person not receiving a prize who is a member of such a Team or Organization.\n\u00a0\nBy submitting Entrant Content, each Entrant (if the Entrant is a Team, this shall refer to each individual member of such Team holding intellectual property rights in the Entrant Content) grants to the Contest Entities (and their agents, successors, and assigns) the irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable, absolute right and permission (including the rights in Articles 27 and 28 of the Copyright Act of Japan) to use, edit, modify, copy, reproduce, and distribute any such Entrant Content submitted by the Entrant (including its Software and any of Entrant\u2019s trade names or trademarks, including logos) in perpetuity and in any medium now known or hereafter devised (including online and in digital media), anywhere throughout the world and in any language, without further obligation or compensation of any kind to Entrant, for the purposes of administering this Contest and for the Contest Entities\u2019 advertising, trade, promotional and publicity purposes, and shall not exercise its moral rights (the right to make any Entrant Content public, right to determine the display of the author\u2019s name, and right to preserve the integrity of any Entrant Content). Aside from the rights granted the Contest Entities under these Terms, Entrant remains (as between Entrant and the Contest Entities) the owner of all right, title, and interest in and to the Entrant\u2019s Entrant Content.\nEach Entrant hereby acknowledges and agrees that the relationship between the Entrant and each of the Contest Entities is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other special relationship, and that the Entrant\u2019s decision to submit his/her/its Entry for purposes of the Contest does not place any of the Contest Entities in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public with regard to elements of the Entry (including, without limitation, the Software), other than as set forth in these Terms. (For the sake of clarity and without limiting the foregoing, these Terms do not purport to modify the terms of any separate agreement between Sponsor and any Entrant, including any confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement.) Each Entrant understands and acknowledges that the Contest Entities have wide access to ideas, text, images, code, applications, software, and other creative materials. Each Entrant also acknowledges that many ideas for games, other applications, or online services may be competitive with, similar to, or identical to its Software and/or each other in idea, function, components, format, or other respects. Each Entrant acknowledges and agrees that such Entrant will not be entitled to any compensation as a result of any Contest Entity\u2019s use of any such similar or identical material that has or may come to such Contest Entity from other sources. Each Entrant acknowledges and agrees that no Contest Entity has now or will have in the future any duty or liability (direct or indirect; vicarious, contributory, or otherwise) with respect to the infringement or protection of the Entrant\u2019s patent, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to his/her/its Software or any other part of its Entrant Content. Each Entrant acknowledges that, with respect to any claim by Entrant relating to or arising out of a Contest Entity\u2019s actual or alleged exploitation or use of any Entrant Content (including the Software), the damage, if any, thereby caused to the applicable Entrant will not be irreparable or otherwise sufficient to entitle such Entrant to seek injunctive or other equitable relief or in any way enjoin the production, distribution, exhibition, or other exploitation of any Contest Entity application, service or other property, and Entrant\u2019s rights and remedies in any such event are strictly limited to the right to recover damages, if any, in an action at law.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Released Parties are not responsible and/or liable for any of the following, whether caused by a Released Party, the Entrant (or a member of any Entrant Team or Organization), or by human error (except to the extent that any of the following occur for reasons within Sponsor's reasonable control, if applicable law in your jurisdiction of residence dictates that liability to the injured party in such a case cannot be excluded by law): Entries or votes made by illegitimate means (such as, without limitation, by an automated computer program) or in excess of the above-stated limit; any lost, late, postage-due, incomplete, illegible, incomprehensible, mutilated, or misdirected email, mail, or Contest-related correspondence or materials; any error, omission, interruption, defect, or delay in transmission or communication; viruses or technical or mechanical malfunctions; interrupted or unavailable telephonic, cellular, cable, or satellite systems; errors, typos or misprints in these Terms, in any Contest-related advertisements or other materials; failures of electronic equipment, computer hardware or software; lost or unavailable network connections or any failed, incorrect, incomplete, inaccurate, garbled or delayed electronic communications; technical or human error which may occur in the administration of the Contest or the processing of Entries; or any injury or damage to persons or property which may be caused, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from Entrant's participation in the Contest or receipt or use of any prize. Without limiting any other provision of these Terms, no Released Party is responsible or liable for any injury or damage to the persons or property of Entrant or any third party based on use by such party of Entrant\u2019s Software or other Entrant Content made available as part of this Contest or based on any use by Entrant of the Software or Entrant Content of any other participant in this Contest. Released Parties are not responsible for electronic communications that are undeliverable as a result of any form of active or passive filtering of any kind, or for insufficient space in a person\u2019s email account or voicemail inbox to receive email or voice messages. No Released Party is responsible or will have any liability for any purported Entrant Content (including, without limitation, any Progress Video) that is removed from any Hosting Site for any reason at any time prior to the award of the prizes in this Contest, including removal by a Hosting Site of a purported Progress Video in response to such content being \u201cflagged\u201d or reported as inappropriate. No Released Party is responsible for changes to any Hosting Site or any of the functionality of any such Hosting Site that may interfere with the Contest or ability of an Entrant to participate. Released Parties are not responsible, and may disqualify an Entrant, if any contact information provided by the Entrant does not work or is changed without giving prior written notice to Sponsor. Without limiting any other provision in these Terms, the Released Parties are not responsible or liable to any Entrant or winner (or any person claiming through such Entrant or winner) for failure to supply a prize or any part thereof in the event that any of the Contest activities or Released Parties\u2019 operations or activities are affected by any cause or event beyond the sole and reasonable control of the applicable Released Party (as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion), including, without limitation, by reason of any acts of God, equipment failure, threatened or actual terrorist acts, air raid, act of public enemy, war (declared or undeclared), civil disturbance, insurrection, riot, epidemic, fire, explosion, earthquake, flood, hurricane, unusually severe weather, blackout, embargo, labor dispute or strike (whether legal or illegal), labor or material shortage, transportation interruption of any kind, work slow-down, any law, rule, regulation, action, order, or request adopted, taken, or made by any governmental or quasi-governmental entity (whether or not such governmental act proves to be invalid), or any other cause, whether or not specifically mentioned above.\nThe following specific terms only apply for Entrants that reside in Germany.

A \u201eCARDINAL DUTY\u201c IN THE MEANING OF THIS PROVISION IS AN OBLIGATION WHOSE FULFILLMENT MAKES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS CONTRACT POSSIBLE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND ON THE FULFILLMENT OF WHICH THE CONTRACTUAL PARTNER MAY THEREFORE GENERALLY RELY.\n(III)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IN A CASE ACCORDING TO CLAUSE (II), THE INDICATED PARTIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LACK OF COMMERCIAL SUCCESS, LOST PROFITS AND INDIRECT DAMAGES.\n(IV)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LIABILITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ABOVE CLAUSES (II) AND (III) SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE TYPICAL, FORESEEABLE DAMAGES.\n(V)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY ON THE PART OF THE INDICATED PARTIES FOR ANY WARRANTIES AND FOR CLAIMS BASED ON THE GERMAN PRODUCT LIABILITY ACT SHALL REMAIN UNAFFECTED.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBy entering this Contest (except where prohibited by law), each natural person signing these Terms as part of an Entry (as the Entrant OR AS an Entrant Team or Organization) grants the Contest Entities the irrevocable, sublicensable, free-of-charge, absolute right and permission to use, publish, post or display his or her name, photograph, likeness, voice, biographical information, any quotes attributable to him or her, and any other indicia of persona (regardless of whether altered, changed, modified, edited, used alone, or used with other material in the Contest Entities\u2019 sole discretion) for advertising, trade, promotional and publicity purposes related to the Contest and the awarding of prizes without further obligation or compensation of any kind to him or her, anywhere worldwide, in any medium now known or hereafter discovered or devised (including, without limitation, on the Internet) without any limitation of time and without notice, review or approval, and each such person releases all Contest Entities from any and all liability related to such authorized uses. Nothing contained in these Terms obligates any Contest Entity to make use of any of the rights granted herein and each natural person granting publicity rights under this provision waives any right to inspect or approve any such use.\nSponsor's decisions will be final in all matters relating to this Contest, including interpretation of these Terms, acceptance or rejection of Entrants, Entries, or votes, selection of the winners, and awarding of the prizes. All Entrants, as a condition of entry, agree to be bound by these Terms. Failure to comply with these Terms may result in disqualification from the Contest. Participants further agree to not damage or cause interruption of the Contest and/or prevent others from participating in the Contest. Sponsor reserves the right to restrict or void participation (including, without limitation, votes) from any IP address, email address or domain, device, or other designator or identifiable source if any Entry, vote, and/or participation is suspected to be fraudulent, as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion. Sponsor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to void Entries, votes, or other participation by any person or entity who Sponsor believes has attempted to tamper with or impair the administration, security, fairness or proper play of this Contest. In the event there is an alleged or actual ambiguity, discrepancy or inconsistency between disclosures or other statements contained in any Contest-related materials and these Terms (including any alleged discrepancy or inconsistency within these Terms), it will be resolved by Sponsor in its sole discretion. Participants waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Contest or these Terms. If Sponsor determines (at any time and in its sole discretion) that any winner or potential winner is disqualified, ineligible, in violation of these Terms, or engaging in behavior that Sponsor deems obnoxious, inappropriate, threatening, illegal or that is intended to annoy, abuse, or harass any other person or entity, Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify such winner or potential winner, even if the disqualified winner or potential winner may have been notified or displayed or announced anywhere. Sponsor's failure to or decision not to enforce any provision in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of that or any other provision. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these Terms will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. In the event that any provision is determined to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, these Terms will otherwise remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with their terms as if the invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein. If the Contest is not capable of running as planned for any reason (including, without limitation, as a result of actual or suspected fraud or other improper participation or votes), Sponsor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel, modify or suspend the Contest and award the prizes based on eligible, non-suspect Entries received prior to cancellation, modification, or suspension, if any, or as otherwise deemed fair and appropriate by Sponsor. If any person supplies false information, participates or submits Entries or votes by fraudulent means, or is otherwise determined to be in violation of these Terms in an attempt to obtain a prize, Sponsor may disqualify that person (and any Entrant on the behalf of which such person participated in the Contest) and seek damages from him or her and that person may be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. If any dispute regarding an Entry cannot be resolved to Sponsor's satisfaction, such Entry will be deemed ineligible. CAUTION: ANY ATTEMPT TO DAMAGE ANY ONLINE SERVICE OR WEBSITE OR UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMATE OPERATION OF THE CONTEST MAY VIOLATE CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LAWS. IF SUCH AN ATTEMPT IS MADE, SPONSOR MAY DISQUALIFY ANY PARTICIPANT MAKING SUCH ATTEMPT AND MAY SEEK DAMAGES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\n\u00a0\n\nExcept where prohibited by law, any and all disputes, claims, and causes of action between a participant and any Released Party arising out of or connected with this Contest, the determination of any winner, or any prize awarded must be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action.
