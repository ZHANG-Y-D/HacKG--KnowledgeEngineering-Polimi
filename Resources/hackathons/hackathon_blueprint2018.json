To ensure fairness during the hackathon, qualified entries are restricted to those started within the hackathon hours. Projects that contain code written before the official hacking start time will be disqualified; however, exceptions to this rule are made for publicly available open-source code and libraries. Submission of another group\u2019s or individual\u2019s work is considered cheating and will result in disqualification. Only work built during the event will be considered for prizes. The Blueprint team reserves the right to disqualify projects for other forms of cheating not specified here. In particular, misrepresentation of your hack, accidental or not, is considered cheating. For example, if you use an API or library in your backend and you do not disclose that you did not implement it yourself, you are eligible for disqualification.", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "Nintendo Switches", "prize-title": "Main 1st Place"}, {"prize-content": "Bose SoundLink Mini II", "prize-title": "Main 2nd Place"}, {"prize-content": "GoPro Hero Session", "prize-title": "Beginner 1st Place"}, {"prize-content": "Fitbit Flex2", "prize-title": "Beginner 2nd Place"}, {"prize-content": "Raspberry Pi", "prize-title": "Beginner 3rd Place"}, {"prize-content": "Special Prizes!", "prize-title": "Most Blueprint Spirit"}, {"prize-content": "Special Prizes!", "prize-title": "Wildest Hack!!"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=75 Amherst St, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA", "hackathon-url": "https://blueprint2018.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": ""}], "hackathon-location-address": "75 Amherst St, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA", "hackathon-description-header": "Blueprint is a weekend-long learnathon and hackathon for local high school students held at MIT's campus.
