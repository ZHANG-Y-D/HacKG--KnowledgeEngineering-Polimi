Each team will explore new technologies, try out new techniques, solutions and practices in any way they see fit. We expect to see teams hack away at prototypes to validate their exciting new ideas, intense collaboration within the teams, networking and knowledge sharing amongst the different teams. In short: having a lot of fun and learning a lot of new stuff.
