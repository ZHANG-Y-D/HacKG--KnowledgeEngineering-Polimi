Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and racist, sexist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for this event. If at any point you see a fellow hacker being harassed, it\u2019s your responsibility to talk to the nearest hackathon organizer.\n2.) \n Without them, nothing would be possible. Take some time out of your work to go meet and speak with them. If they come over to talk to you, look up from your work and give them a bit of your time. They're here for you! Show them you appreciate it.\n3.) \n All teams retain full ownership of what they have created during the hackathon.\n4.) \n We want to ensure that all participants start off on the same footing and we also want to preserve the true nature of a hackathon. You are, however, free to make plans, create wireframes, and brainstorm prior to the event.\nThe only exception to this rule would include material that is freely available to the public. Some examples of this would be: public domain images, Creative Commons music, open source libraries, existing APIs and platforms, and the like. Failure to comply may result in the offending team's disqualification.\n\n5.) \n Hackathons are amazing, and so are you. We\u2019re so happy you\u2019re able to hack with us and be a part of our amazing community.\n6.) \n Hacking unites people from across the world from different cultural norms, nationalities, and backgrounds. Be prepared not only to learn something new from your hack, but also from the amazing people around you. Be mindful of the fact that certain content and actions can make the people around you uncomfortable. \n We'll let you know if you should consider rethinking your hack.\n7.) \n Never be afraid of competing based on where you come from or have preconceptions of grandeur because you come from a great school. At any time one can achieve greatness. You simply have to see it and seize it.\n\u00a0", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "$10,000 straight cash, $50,000 optional investment from TechSquare Labs, $60,000 Microsoft Azure credit, Full provisional patent filing through IPSmartup and Full utility patent filling through IPSmartup", "prize-title": "Grand Prize: $60,000 cash + $60,000 Azure Credit"}, {"prize-content": "Full provisional patent filing through IPSmartup", "prize-title": "2nd place"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "3rd place"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Top 10"}, {"prize-content": "128GB iPad Mini with Retina display (Wi-Fi) for each member of the team (sponsored by Apple)", "prize-title": "Top iOS App"}, {"prize-content": "The winning team will be awarded with a trip to Boston and will have a chance to interview for a position at TripAdvisor", "prize-title": "TripAdvisor Prize"}, {"prize-content": "Custom action figures of the winning team's members from Twilio!", "prize-title": "Best use of Twilio API"}, {"prize-content": "128GB iPad Mini with Retina display (Wi-Fi) for each member of the team (sponsored by Apple)", "prize-title": "Top hardware hack that integrates with iOS"}, {"prize-content": "iPads for all team members from eBay!", "prize-title": "Best use of eBay API"}, {"prize-content": "$200 in Uber credit for each hacker on the team that wins, sponsored by Uber.
