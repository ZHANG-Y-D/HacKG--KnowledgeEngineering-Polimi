But we have to set some simple rules to make it a honest and fair event for all:\n\nThis is, by all means, the most important rule. This is a very diverse environment, made up of many races, religions, sexual orientations, genders, and gender identities. Any behavior or presentation that objectifies or belittles others will be halted, with the presenters immediately disqualified and removed from the event. For more information surrounding our policies on harassment,\u00a0please go to Major Leage Hacking as we will implement their excellent code of conduct .\n\nThis isn\u2019t a slidedeck hackathon! Build and demonstrate a working project or prototype, don\u2019t just show us screenshots and slides. Seriously, we will disqualify you.\n\nThe project you present must be coded entirely during the Hackathon. The only exceptions are for publicly available frameworks/APIs and open-source code that has been available for at least a month. If it feels shady to use the code, don\u2019t.\n\nAll submitted Entries should directly address one or more of the event challenges, as described on our\u00a0\n\u00a0to be eligible for posting. Entries not addressing a challenge will be posted publicly at our sole discretion. By submitting a solution, you grant us permission to display, copy, combine, compile, distribute and disseminate your Entry as needed to support the Event and audit your code. All Entries will be reviewed prior to posting.\u00a0\n\nParticipants\u00a0will have their code audited to make sure it\u2019s all new and legit, by a developer appointed by Imaging Mind. Your code belongs to you and we won\u2019t share it with anyone, but we will want to see it if you win.\n\nUse Git or an equivalent to track your code as you write it. It\u2019s good practice, and if it comes down to an audit, it\u2019ll help you prove your code is new.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an opportunity to promote your team\u2019s pre-existing product. Don\u2019t tack one tiny feature onto your existing product and call it a day. Keep it honest and fair and build something new & exciting!\n\nYou must present your hack as described in your submission \u2013 if you deviate from your accepted submission, we\u2019ll have to boot you from the stage. Don\u2019t submit one thing and then abuse the stage and respect of the audience to present something different.\n\nWe\u2019re limiting the number of members per team at 5, in the interest of keeping things fair. You can also only be part of one team.\n\nAll intellectual property rights of hacks produced at the event belong to the attendees, and not to the organisers, sponsors, or partners.\nyou own the IP, be nice to each other and finally, regarding privacy, you will be at a public event that will be photographed and filmed.
