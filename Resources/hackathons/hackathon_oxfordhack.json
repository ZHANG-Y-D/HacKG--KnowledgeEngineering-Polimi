Teams can work on existing projects but during the presentation the team must clearly outline the part that was written during the hackathon and it shall be only judged on this part. Digital mockups and graphics may be prepared before. Additionally open-source frameworks and code that is available to everyone may be used. If you use another project of yours inside your hack it must be available to everyone and please mention it in the README in your repository.\nEven though the code quality is not a criteria, judges and organizers have to be granted a look on the source code on request. This might be necessary in cases where the judges or organziers question whether the code was written at the event.\nTeams of up to 4 humans are allowed. You can also add 1 cyborg, Furby, drone, or Sphero. (Credits to AngelHack)\nAs we are hacking on a university campus, we need to be able to clearly identify participants and non-participants. That's why we ask everyone to wear the lanyards and name tags we hand out and clearly display the badge with their name. It is also not permitted to pass either of it on to non-participants. If the organizers see youdo this, the partcipant may be immediately banned from the event.\nIn order to participate in the actual competition and present your hack your team must be registered on the Devpost\u00a0page of the event.\nUntil submission deadline all teams must be registered and \n need to have joined the team. Additionally a link to the repository needs to be posted in the team page. Video submissions are optional.\nThe ownership for everything build at the event remains with the team and the team is free to do with it what it wants.\nIn order to participate in the competition it is necessary that you demo your hack at the expo. PowerPoint slides or other slide decks are not allowed. Neither at the expo nor at\u00a0the final presentations. Don't be scared to present unfinished hacks. You can still have a chance to win :)\nThe judging of the hackathon will have two phases. In the first phase every team has the chance to present to\u00a0some judges as part of the expo. Afterwards the\u00a0best teams will be chosen to present on stage in front of all participants and the final jury. Everyone who presents in front of the final\u00a0jury starts with a blank slate. Previous scores will not be counted for the final decision.\u00a0\nIn both cases the rule is that the decisions of the jury members and organizers are final and shall not be questioned.\nWe want a fair competition and are not planning to disqualify anyone however if any of the following things is violated we sadly have to disqualify you (and in cases your team):", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "4 Arduino Starter Kits, 4 sets of magical books, and 4 Alexa Dots!", "prize-title": "1st Prize"}, {"prize-content": "4 sets of magical books, and 4 Alexa Dots!", "prize-title": "2nd Prize"}, {"prize-content": "4 Alexa Dots!", "prize-title": "3rd Prize"}, {"prize-content": "Esri sponsored prize!", "prize-title": "Tickets to WBStudioTour or price equivalent amazon vouchers"}, {"prize-content": "Best use of Skyscanner API - Skyscanner travel vouchers", "prize-title": "Skyscanner API Prize"}, {"prize-content": "Use your tech skills for good and hack online harassment.
