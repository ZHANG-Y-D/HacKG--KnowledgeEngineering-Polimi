{"hackathon-description-text": "\nEach day in Massachusetts, travelers throughout the state make individual decisions on how to reach their destinations. Together, the public\u2019s transportation \u201cmode choice\u201d translates into significant outcomes which impact residents across the Commonwealth in many ways, including through traffic congestion, travel costs, and carbon emissions. \u00a0To better understand traffic flows throughout the state, MassDOT installed pilot network of roadway sensors to provide real-time traffic management (RTTM) information on three major roadways- 93, I-90, and Rt. 3. Each of these roadway \u201ccorridors\u201d is paralleled by at least one light rail line. The Mass Transportation Future Hackathon will engage the public to show compelling insights from the available data, with a special priority around presenting the differences between driving vs. riding the train through specific corridors. The event is designed to encourage participants to choose their own most compelling \u201clens\u201c through which to analyze the data, which may include: travel cost, emissions, time delays, etc.", "hackathon-number-of-prizes": "3", "hackathon-id": "masstransporthack", "hackathon-judges": [{"judge-role": "Senior Manager for Big Data & Tech Initiatives, Mass Tech Collaborative", "judge-name": "Christopher Scranton"}, {"judge-role": "Former Mass.
