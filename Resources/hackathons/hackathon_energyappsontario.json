In the event of a tie between two or more Submissions, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first criterion listed above shall be deemed the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated by comparing the tied Submissions\u2019 scores on the second, and third criterion listed above, respectively. If two or more Submissions are tied on all three criteria, the panel of Judges, in its sole discretion, will vote on the tied submissions (the \u201cTie-Breaker Criteria\u201d).\n\u00a0\nA.
