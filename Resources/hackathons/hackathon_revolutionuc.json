{"hackathon-description-text": "\nRevolution UC is open to all high school, undergraduate and graduate students, including freshmen! You don't have to attend the University of Cincinnati; you don't have to be a computer science major or even an engineering student, though you should have some coding or engineering experience. You aren't required to have ever attended a hackathon before: we will have tech talks beforehand so you can ramp up quickly. You can come with a team or come alone. We will have sessions to help people find team members and/or form teams, as well as an idea workshops to help people think of ideas to work on for the hackathon.", "hackathon-number-of-prizes": "7", "hackathon-id": "revolutionuc", "hackathon-judges": [{"judge-role": "Professor Computer Science | University of Cincinnati", "judge-name": "Paul Talaga"}, {"judge-role": "President-Executive Office | University of Cincinnati", "judge-name": "Ben Hofstetter"}, {"judge-role": "UC Mobile App Lab | University of Cincinnati", "judge-name": "Asif Riaz"}, {"judge-role": "CTO Zipscene", "judge-name": "Mark Schneider"}, {"judge-role": "Zipscene", "judge-name": "Chris Breneman"}, {"judge-role": "Director of Engineering", "judge-name": "Dave Doster"}, {"judge-role": "zipscene", "judge-name": "Tony Blankemeyer"}, {"judge-role": "Partner, Differential", "judge-name": "Gerard Sychay"}, {"judge-role": "zipscene", "judge-name": "Mohamed Berete"}], "hackathon-number-of-judges": "9", "hackathon-eligibility": "", "hackathon-number-of-participants": "69", "hackathon-is-colocated": "True", "hackathon-has-ended": "False", "hackathon-number-of-judging-criteria": "3", "hackathon-requirements": "", "hackathon-rules": "", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "Up to 4 Nexus 7s and 1 year WolframAlpha Pro and Mathematica and GitHub TShirt", "prize-title": "First Place"}, {"prize-content": "Up to 4 Pebbles and 1 year WolframAlpha Pro and Mathematica and GitHub TShirts", "prize-title": "Second Place"}, {"prize-content": "Up to 4 64GB Flash Drive and 1 year WolframAlpha Pro and Mathematica and GitHub TShirts", "prize-title": "Third Place"}, {"prize-content": "iPad Mini or Amazon gift cards", "prize-title": "Best IOS"}, {"prize-content": "Nexus or Amazon gift cards", "prize-title": "Best Android"}, {"prize-content": "Lunch with Dean Lim & 3D-printed models of McMicken", "prize-title": "Project that most improves UC Student Experience"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Best Newbie Hack"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=University of Cincinnati, University of Cincinnati - Medical College, 2600 Clifton Avenue, Cincinnati, OH 45220, USA", "hackathon-url": "https://revolutionuc.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": "Would the application have real social impact?
