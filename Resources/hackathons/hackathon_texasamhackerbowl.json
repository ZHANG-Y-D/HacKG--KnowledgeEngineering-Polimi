This event is for any college student in the state of Texas that is, or aspires to be a Hacker.\n\nIt is highly encouraged that you find a team of four Hackers from your school to compete with. However, if you are unable to do so we\u2019ll be able to place you on another team at the start of the competition.\u00a0\nYou should definitely discuss ideas with your team before the event. The earlier you start planning, the cooler the Hack will be!\n\nIn order to compete in the competition you must stay for the entire Hackathon. You\u2019re allowed to arrive to the competition late, but all code for your project must be written on site.\n\nTeams are not allowed to use code they have written prior to the competition in their project. However, certain circumstances exceptions can be made if the software/hardware doesn\u2019t present a competitive advantage for the team. If you have any doubt whether or not your project will be allowed just let us know and we\u2019ll see what we can do.
