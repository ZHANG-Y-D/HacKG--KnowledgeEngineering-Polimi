Use of publicly available 3rd party assets and libraries is allowed, as is using material from past projects with the approval of the Hackathon Organizers.\u00a0\nTeams must be no larger than eight members.\nTo be eligible for prizes, projects must be submitted for consideration via the form distributed Sunday morning.\nNo team will be awarded more than one prize.\u00a0This allows us\u00a0to recognize as many teams as possible for their efforts.\nAttendees retain copyright over any material created at the VR Hackathon. The hackathon is, however, a public forum, and any disclosure during it should also be considered public. By submitting a project for consideration for prizes, the project creators grant the Seattle VR Hackathon and its organizers an irrevocable right to\u00a0present the project and related images in its materials and to identify the project as having originated at the Hackathon.\nJudging will proceed as follows:\u00a0Each judge will try a subset of all eligible projects and\u00a0make pairwise comparisons with respect to each of the prize categories.\u00a0This information is used to identify top projects and informs final prize allocation by a panel of all judges acting together.\nThe community choice prize will be awarded based on votes received before the cut-off time announced at the hackathon. Each full participant in the hackathon will be allowed to cast up to five votes, with a limit of one vote per project, and with no votes cast for their own project. In the event of a tie, the prize will be split between the first placing projects.\nAll prizes are awarded at the discretion of the Hackathon Organizers. The procedures described above are for information purposes only, and may be amended without notice by the Organizers during the event.\nThe Organizers reserve the right to disqualify any project team at any time.\nWe, the Seattle VR Hackathon Organizers, are committed to making the VR Hackathon a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or technical expertise (or lack of any of the aforementioned).\nWe will not tolerate harassment of any kind. Harassment may include verbal abuse, sexually explicit or derogatory language, offensive or sexual cartoons or materials, mimicry, offensive gestures,\u00a0unwelcome\u00a0sexual advances, and telling of jokes offensive to others in the community. In general, sexual advances of any kind are considered unwelcome by default and are not appropriate at this event.\nIf, in the eyes of the Organizers, a hackathon participant is seen to have violated these rules, they may be warned, sanctioned, or asked to leave the hackathon without a refund (if applicable). In other words, just do the following: be aware of your actions and their effects on others; don\u2019t treat the hackathon like a dating sim; and, in general, be nice to one another.\u00a0", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "Awarded to the project that offers the best, most interesting, and most compelling solution to a problem related to Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief within one of the scenarios described during opening ceremonies at the hackathon.
