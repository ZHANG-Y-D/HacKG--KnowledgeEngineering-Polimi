{"hackathon-description-text": "\nAUHack is Denmark's\u00a0largest hackathon. Over a 36-hour period from April 13th - 15th, students interested in IT development and IT design will meet and collaborate intensively over a weekend to create prototypes and concepts. Your goal is not to create finished products, but to come up with ideas, play with new technology and make new hacks. It is an opportunity to share your ideas with different people, build cool stuff, learn from our mentors and just have fun. Our goal is to bring students from different fields of study and universities together and set a framework, where you can carry out your projects and ideas. Students for all study programs are welcome, and everybody is there to help each other and have fun!", "hackathon-number-of-prizes": "8", "hackathon-id": "auhack18", "hackathon-judges": [{"judge-role": "David is a hackathon-veteran with 30+ events under his belt.
