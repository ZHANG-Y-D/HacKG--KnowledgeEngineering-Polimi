To this end, we are holding everyone (attendees, volunteers, and mentors alike) to a couple of rules.\n1.\u00a0\nEveryone here is a human being with thoughts and feelings of their own. Respect everyone\u2019s boundaries, be considerate, and think before you speak.\n2.\u00a0\nIf you actively harass, discriminate against, or hurt any other attendee,\u00a0\n. Everyone deserves a safe and comfortable environment to hack and have fun in, regardless of race, gender identity, sexual orientation, transgender status, disability, or any other characteristic of their being. Remember that bias (sexism, homophobia, etc.) can be subtle. And don\u2019t be lewd or tell crass jokes.\n3.\u00a0\nYou may think that your showing off won\u2019t hurt anyone, but it may put people down and make them feel unqualified to be here. If someone doesn\u2019t know something, don\u2019t be dramatic and make them feel dumb. Instead, teach them about it. They probably know a lot that you don\u2019t, too.\n4.\u00a0\nYes, you are competing for prizes. And yes, you should be competitive and try to make your hack the best it can be. But don\u2019t go overboard. If you spend all of your time trying to one-up someone else, neither of you will enjoy yourselves. HackHealth aims to be as stress-free an environment as possible.\n5.\u00a0\nNo one wants to spend 12 hours hacking in a dumpster. Please throw away your trash and be careful not to make a mess. And for the love of all that compiles, be careful with your drinks! (For those of you who don\u2019t know, there are computers in the desks.) If HackHealth ends up damaging equipment or leaving behind a humungous mess, we won\u2019t be allowed to have food in the rooms ever again.\nBy coming to HackHealth, you agree to abide by all of these rules from the moment you step through the door. If you violate these rules, we will give you a warning. If you continue to violate them, you will be disqualified and asked to leave.\nIf you experience any issues, harassment, or discrimination; if anyone is doing anything to make you or others uncomfortable; if you fear for your safety or the safety of someone else, please do not hesitate to tell us. You can tap an E-Board member to speak privately or you can leave us an anonymous note on the podium at the front of the room. Don\u2019t think that you just have to put up with it.\nAnd if you hear or see anyone doing something against the rules, or just being a jerk, don\u2019t be afraid to tell them so. In many cases, especially if it\u2019s subtle, they may not know that they are doing something wrong, and your words will make them a better person. If they become confrontational, we will back you up. Please help us make HackHealth a good experience for everyone.", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "Google Drawstring Bag, Google Pillow Plushie, Facebook Item, Battery Pack, Blender Bottle", "prize-title": "Best Mental Health Hack"}, {"prize-content": "Google Drawstring Bag, Google Pillow Plushie, Facebook Item, Battery Pack, Blender Bottle", "prize-title": "Best Nutrition Hack"}, {"prize-content": "Google Drawstring Bag, Google Pillow Plushie, Facebook Item, Battery Pack, Blender Bottle", "prize-title": "Best Fitness Hack"}, {"prize-content": "Google Drawstring Bag, Google Pillow Plushie, Facebook Item, Battery Pack, Blender Bottle", "prize-title": "Best Medicine Hack"}, {"prize-content": "Google Drawstring Bag, Google Pillow Plushie, Facebook Item, Battery Pack, Blender Bottle", "prize-title": "First Time Hackers"}, {"prize-content": "Google Drawstring Bag, Google Pillow Plushie, Facebook Item, Battery Pack, Blender Bottle", "prize-title": "Best UI/UX"}, {"prize-content": "Google Drawstring Bag, Google Pillow Plushie, Facebook Item, Battery Pack, Blender Bottle", "prize-title": "Most Innovative Hack"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=400 Circle Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11790, USA", "hackathon-url": "https://hackhealth-2018-6046.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": "About one in five adults in America experience a mental health condition.
