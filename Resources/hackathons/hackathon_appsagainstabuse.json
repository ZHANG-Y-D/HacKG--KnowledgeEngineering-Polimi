{"hackathon-description-text": "\nYoung women face the highest rates of dating violence and sexual assault. Nineteen percent of women (nearly 1 in 5) report experiencing sexual assault while in college. Many of these assaults occur when the offender, often an acquaintance, has targeted and isolated a young woman in vulnerable circumstances. \u201cBystander\u201d campaigns teach peers how to identify these circumstances and intervene before an assault occurs.\u00a0 Dating violence also disproportionately affects young women in this demographic. Young people turn to each other for help more often than they turn to parents, but most don\u2019t know how to intervene if a friend needs help. Seventy-five percent of college students say that it is important to intervene, but over half say they don\u2019t know how. Moreover, sixty percent of college students who have been in an abusive relationship say no one helped them. Websites, hotlines and resources are available for those who have experienced or are currently experiencing violence and abuse.\u00a0 However, few tools currently exist to proactively prevent violence and abuse from occurring.", "hackathon-number-of-prizes": "1", "hackathon-id": "appsagainstabuse", "hackathon-judges": [{"judge-role": "Senior Health Technology Advisor, HHS", "judge-name": "Dr. Audie A.
