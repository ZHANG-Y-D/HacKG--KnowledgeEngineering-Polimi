Every hour, some 100 migrant workers leave the Philippines. Overseas Filipinos are typically known to be as doctors, accountants, IT professionals, engineers, technicians, entertainers, teachers, nurses, seamen, military servicemen, domestic helpers and caregivers.\n\nThis staggering number brought positive and negative effects in the lives of the Filipinos and of the country in general. Some of the challenges faced by Filipino migrant/expatriate workers are common to anyone who works overseas: lack of security if lacking permanent residence, sometimes disadvantageous foreign exchange rates when sending money back home, vulnerability to abuse by employers.\n\nIn line with this, local C4TK organizers decided to make OFW Challenges as the central focus for this year\u2019s hackathon.\n\n\n\n", "hackathon-number-of-participants": "12", "hackathon-is-colocated": "True", "hackathon-has-ended": "False", "hackathon-number-of-judging-criteria": "6", "hackathon-requirements": "\n\n", "hackathon-rules": "\n\n\n\n\nCode for the Kingdom is a weekend hackathon and ongoing ecosystem where global issues are tackled from a Christian perspective.
