In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions\u2019 scores on the next applicable criterion. If two or more Submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Submissions.\n\u00a0\n\n\nPlease review the Devpost Hackathon Terms of Service at \n for voting rules.\n\u00a0\n\nIn addition to the requirements in Section 3, Makers (including all team members, if a team submission) must:\n\nTHE AWARD OF A PRIZE TO A POTENTIAL WINNER IS SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION OF THE IDENTITY, QUALIFICATIONS AND ROLE OF THE POTENTIAL WINNER IN THE CREATION OF THE SUBMISSION.
