You'll need a well-rounded team, with business development-, UX- and coding-skills. Remember: we're looking for teams to code an app, prepare a business model\u00a0and record\u00a0a pitch video.\nThe competition is open to all: students and members of the public.\u00a0Contestants under 18 will need to be accompanied by a parent or guardian.", "hackathon-number-of-participants": "43", "hackathon-is-colocated": "True", "hackathon-has-ended": "False", "hackathon-number-of-judging-criteria": "5", "hackathon-requirements": "\nDuring the competition you'll be coding an app, preparing a Business Model Canvas\u00a0and a pitch video.\nYou'll need to enter the details of your project here in DevPost, along with links to your app and Business Model Canvas. It will be a good idea to familiarise yourself ahead of UHack Tasmania with DevPost projects, the submission process, preparing YouTube videos and Google Docs.", "hackathon-rules": "\nOur hackathon is dedicated to providing an empowering, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, previous hackathon attendance or computing experience (or lack of any of the aforementioned).\nWe do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any hackathon venue, including hacks, talks, workshops, parties, social media and other online media. Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon without a refund (if applicable) at the discretion of the hackathon organisers.\nWhilst the event will be an opportunity to apply what you've learnt from browsing APIs, datasets or websites prior to the event, the event will be relying on you commencing work on you project\u00a0only from the Saturday morning. The only exception to this rule is if it's been made Open Source, freely available for use by other teams and in the public-domain.\nPrior to the event, feel free to fill your boots with learning about relevant University research, themes, etc., all of which will help you once the event kicks off and perhaps give you the edge you need. But don't pre-build - if we detect it, your entry will be jeopardised.\n", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Check the UHack site for prize details."}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=91/93 Macquarie St, Hobart TAS 7000, Australia", "hackathon-url": "https://uhack-tasmania-2016.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": "Your business model on one page, making it easy to understand: the unmet need, the users/customers, what's unique about your solution, how you will get your solution to the users, how you expect to cover your costs, and what's your unfair advantage?"}, {"judging-criterion": "How well executed is your app, game or website, etc.?
