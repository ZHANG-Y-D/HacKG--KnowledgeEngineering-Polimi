in order for his/her team to be eligible to participate, all of the members of the team must register and accept the Rules. The Contestants assume the responsibility for identifying each member of a team at the time the team submits its Entry, and Infusionsoft does not assume any responsibility for checking the identification of team members. The members of a team that are identified with the submission of an Entry shall be final and that team may not add, remove or substitute members, or otherwise change the composition of the team, for the duration of the Competition. Furthermore, a Contestant that is part of a team understands and agrees that if his/her team is selected to receive a prize, each Contestant on the team is responsible for ensuring the prize is appropriately distributed to each member of the team. Finally, in order to remain eligible to win a prize, the team and each member of that team must satisfy the eligibility requirements in these Rules, including the submission of a Contest Prize Validation Agreement (discussed below); if one member of the team does not comply with these Rules or is disqualified, the team as a whole will be disqualified.\n6.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUSINESS CONTESTANTS: Infusionsoft encourages entries from United States businesses and other United States legal entities.

A Business Entity submitting an Entry shall be legally bound by these Rules by the act of the Contestant(s) acting on its behalf. Each Contestant associated with and/or submitting an Entry for or on behalf of a Business Entity acknowledges and agrees that if the Contestant enters the Competition without obtaining the requisite authorization, Infusionsoft may, in its sole discretion, disqualify the Business Entity and any submitted Entry.
