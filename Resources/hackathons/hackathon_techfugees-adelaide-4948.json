Australia\u2019s productivity is also disadvantaged.\nThe dramatic increase in global migration has led to rising numbers of families being separated along perilous routes through diverse countries\nWithout access to interpreters, refugees and asylum seekers with limited English are unable to negotiate systems, access services or understand critical information about themselves and yet funding for interpreting services is diminishing and many people are not offered access.", "hackathon-rules": "\nTechfugees both in Australia and internationally, is apolitical and sits above and outside any political ideologies relating to asylum seeker and refugee policies.
