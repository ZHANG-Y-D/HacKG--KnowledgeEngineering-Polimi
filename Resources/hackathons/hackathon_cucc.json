If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable at an officially sanctioned MLH event, if the event itself is creating an unsafe or inappropriate environment, or if interacting with a MLH representative or event organizer makes you uncomfortable, please report it using the procedures included in this document. Major League Hacking stands for inclusivity. We believe that every single person has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment. Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what you\u2019re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, and anyone else at the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the event. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Major League Hacking may take any action MLH deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type.\nIf you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Major League Hacking using the reporting procedures defined below. MLH representatives will be happy to help participants contact campus security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.\nWe expect participants to follow these rules at all hackathon venues, hackathon-related social events, and on hackathon supplied transportation.\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable or think there may be a potential violation of the code of conduct, please report it immediately using one of the following methods. All reporters have the right to remain anonymous.\n\u00a0\nBy sending information to the general reporting line, your report will go to any or all of the five MLH representatives listed below. \u25cf USA General Reporting - +1 (409) 202-6060, incidents@mlh.io \u25cf UK General Reporting - +44 80 0808 5675, incidents@mlh.io\n\nIf you are uncomfortable reporting your situation to one or more of these people or need to contact any of them directly in case of emergency, direct contact details are listed below. \u25cf Jon Gottfried - +1 (212) 851-6746, jon@mlh.io \u25cf Li Chen - +1 (301) 679-7171 , li@mlh.io \u25cf Nick Quinlan - +1 (510) 859-8578, nq@mlh.io \u25cf Swift - +1 (347) 220-8667, swift@mlh.io \u25cf Tim Fogarty - +44 20 3322 7018, tim@mlh.io\nMajor League Hacking reserves the right to revise, make exceptions to, or otherwise amend these policies in whole or in part.
