In the event of a tie between two or more Submissions, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first criterion listed above shall be deemed the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated by comparing the tied Submissions\u2019 scores on the second, and third criterion listed above, respectively. If two or more Submissions are tied on all three criteria, the panel of Judges, in its sole discretion, will vote on the tied submissions (the \u201cTie-Breaker Vote\u201d).\nD. Large Organizations are not eligible to compete for the Best Overall App \u2013 Grand Prize and Runner Up Prize.\nA.

The potential winner of the Popular Choice Award will be determined on the basis of the verified vote counts, as determined by the Sponsor or the Administrator. The Sponsor and the Administrator reserve the right to extend the Voting Period at any time for any reason.\nB. One (1) potential winner of the Popular Choice Award Prize (described in Section 14 below) will be selected based solely on the highest number of votes received from Registered Visitors on the Competition Website.\u00a0 If there is a tie between or among two or more Submissions for the Popular Choice Award, the higher scoring Submission will be determined by the Tie-Breaker Vote (described in Section 10(c) above).\nC. The likelihood of a Submission being selected to win a Popular Choice Award depends on the total number of verified votes received for the Submissions relative to other Contestants.\nD. Use of a manual or automated process or similar method, or multiple e-mail addresses, to submit more than one vote is strictly prohibited. \u00a0Any attempt to circumvent the one-vote limit per person is strictly prohibited and the use of a manual or automated vote processes to do so will subject all votes from the person or entity to disqualification. The Sponsor and/or the Administrator reserves the right to disqualify any Contestant at their sole discretion, if a Contestant receives multiple and/or irregular votes from the same user or users, or receives votes in a manner that otherwise may indicate manual, automated or other vote manipulation. If the voting process for the Popular Choice Award fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, the Sponsor and/or the Administrator at their sole discretion reserve the right to determine the winner by using non-suspect votes, or by any other means the they deem appropriate.\u00a0 If no alternative means of determining a winner of the Popular Choice Award is available or otherwise selected, the Sponsor may terminate the Popular Choice Award without designating a winner. \u00a0\u00a0\nE.\u00a0 Contestants may not directly or indirectly offer or pay any monetary or other form of consideration \u00a0in exchange for a vote.\nA.
