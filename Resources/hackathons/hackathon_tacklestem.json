We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any hackathon venue, including hacks, talks, workshops, parties, social media and other online media. Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon without a refund (if applicable) at the discretion of the hackathon organisers.\nThe Less Quick Version\nHarassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.\nPhotography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).\nParticipants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.\nAs this is a hackathon, we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our hackathon are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.\nSponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.\nIf you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of hackathon staff immediately.\nHackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.\nIf a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organisers may take any action they deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the hackathon with no refund (if applicable), or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.\nWe expect participants to follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues and hackathon-related social events.\"", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "Tickets to", "prize-title": "Pair of tickets to Collision Conference"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Sphero BB-8 Droid"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Amazon Echo"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "WiFi Camera Drone"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "$300 United Airlines Ticket Voucher"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Signed Broncos Football"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Signed Broncos Helmet"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Signed Broncos Jersey"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Bose Headphones"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Bose Speaker"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "$50 Nike Gift Card"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "$50 Visa Gift Card"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "$50 King Soopers Gift Card"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Broncos Hat"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Super Bowl 50 coffee table book"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "VIP Tour of UCHealth Training Center"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Enerplex Phone Chargers"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Otterbox Phone Case"}, {"prize-content": "Auth0 Prize", "prize-title": "SparkFun Johnny-Five Inventor's Kit"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=1701 Bryant St, Denver, CO 80204, USA", "hackathon-url": "https://tacklestem.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": "Though different categories will have slightly different criteria, in general, judges will be looking for awesomeness as described at the bottom of this post:"}], "hackathon-location-address": "1701 Bryant St, Denver, CO 80204, USA", "hackathon-description-header": "Hack at the home of the Denver Broncos with SendGrid, FullContact and more!", "hackathon-prizes-total": "$73,730", "hackathon-location-description": "Sports Authority Field @ Mile High (West United Club Level)", "hackathon-end-date": "", "has-projects": "False"}
