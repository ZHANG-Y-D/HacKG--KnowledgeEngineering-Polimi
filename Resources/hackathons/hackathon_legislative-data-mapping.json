Gaps or issues identified through this challenge will help to shape the evolving Akoma Ntoso international standard.\nThe Library has developed these challenges with the assistance of the Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.K. Parliament's Department of Information Services of the House of Commons, and the Chairs of the OASIS LegalDocumentML Technical Committee.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nCHALLENGE 2 \u2013 Legislative XML Data Mapping\n\u00a0 The Challenge is sponsored by the Library of Congress, 101 Independence Avenue, S.E., Washington, DC\u00a0 20540.\u00a0\u00a0 In these Official Rules, \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer to the Library of Congress.\n\u00a0\u00a0 The Challenge assesses the compatibility of the Akoma Ntoso XML schemas and the U.S. House of Representatives\u2019 DTD and U.K. Crown Legislation Markup Language schema and identifies potential changes to the schemas that would improve their support for U.S. and U.K. legislative data.\nA.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0You may participate in the Challenge if you are:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0at least 18 years old at the time of entry;
