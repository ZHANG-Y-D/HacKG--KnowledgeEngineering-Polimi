If a team or Business Entity is selected as a potential prize recipient, all members of the team or a person with the authority to bind the Business Entity, must enter into the Contest Prize Validation Agreement, which will also provide how the prize should be delivered. Failure to comply with this requirement or to submit any of these documents within the time period specified in an email from Atlassian (or Devpost on behalf of Atlassian) providing the Agreement may mean that the Entry will no longer be eligible to win the applicable prize and Atlassian may, in its sole discretion, select an alternative Contestant to receive the prize.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS: As between Atlassian and the Contestant, the Contestant retains ownership of all intellectual property rights in and to the Entry, including the right to offer and distribute the application commercially, except for the license rights granted in these Rules.
