related information on the Administrators' websites, and (c) to include all or a portion of your App and related information in the Administrators' marketing and promotional materials, including use and mention of such materials at speaking engagements, meetups, and in and at other events or forums.\u00a0 You acknowledge that you will not receive any compensation or credit for use of your App by the Administrators as permitted under this paragraph.\u00a0 For clarity, the offering of any App submission for use by consumers or companies, whether for profit or otherwise, is not permitted by the license granted to the Administrators under this paragraph.\n\u00a0\nSubject to the above license, all Apps submitted to a Hackathon by you, and the intellectual property rights in any such Apps, will remain your property.\n\u00a0\nCONDUCT AND GENERAL CONDITIONS\n\u00a0\nThe Administrators reserve the right to cancel, suspend, and/or modify the Hackathons, or any part of a Hackathon for any reason, including if any fraud, technical failure, or any other factor beyond the Administrators' reasonable control impairs the integrity or proper functioning of the Hackathons.\n\u00a0\nThe Administrators and the judges reserve the right to disqualify any Participant for the following reasons, as determined by the Administrators in their sole discretion:\n\n\nIf, for any reason, your submission or other information is confirmed to have been erroneously deleted, lost, or otherwise destroyed or corrupted, your sole remedy is another submission to the applicable Hackathon if such submission is practical.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA computer specified by the Administrators, in their sole discretion, set to local time, is the official time-keeping device for the Hackathons.\n\u00a0\nThe Administrators' failure, one or more times, to enforce any provision of these Rules will not prevent the Administrators from later enforcing that provision (i.e., will not constitute a waiver of that provision).

Hackathons, and no amendment or modification of these Rules will be valid unless in a writing signed by the Administrators.\u00a0 Should any provision of these Rules be held to be void, invalid or inoperative, the remaining provisions will continue in effect and the invalid provision will be deemed modified to the least degree necessary to remedy such invalidity.\u00a0 In the event that there is an ambiguity, discrepancy or inconsistency between these Rules and any other disclosures or other statements, whether written or oral, contained in any Hackathon-related materials or made at a Hackathon, it will be resolved in the Administrators' sole discretion.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND RELEASE\n\u00a0\nBy participating in a Hackathon, you agree to each of the following:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Administrators from and against any and all claims, expenses, and liabilities (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to violation of third party intellectual property rights as a result of your participation in a Hackathon or submission of an App.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\nTHE ADMINISTRATORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE HACKATHONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.\u00a0 IN NO EVENT SHALL THE ADMINISTRATORS, THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, THE JUDGES, ANY MENTORS PRESENT AT THE HACKATHON ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATORSAND ANY AFFILIATES OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING BE LIABLE FOR ANY ADVICE, INFORMATION, OR DECISIONS MADE FOR OR ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATORS OR FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ECONOMIC DAMAGES OR INJURY TO PROPERTY AND LOST PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED, HAVE OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT WILL KNOW, OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE FOREGOING, EXCEPT AS ARISES FROM THE FRAUD OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE ADMINISTRATORS.\n\u00a0\nGOVERNING LAW; DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\u00a0\nYou agree that:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAny dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Rules that cannot be settled amicably will be finally settled under the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution (\"CPR\") Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration (the \"Arbitration Rules\") by one (1) arbitrator, who must be an attorney with substantial knowledge of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts law and substantial experience in arbitrating commercial disputes under the Arbitration Rules.\u00a0 You and the Administrators may, by agreement, nominate an arbitrator, but if no sole arbitrator is nominated within thirty (30) days from the date the claimant's request for arbitration was served on the other party, the sole arbitrator will be appointed by CPR in accordance with the Arbitration Rules.\u00a0 Unless otherwise agreed, arbitration proceedings will be held in Boston, Massachusetts.\u00a0 The award rendered by the arbitrator will be final and binding, and judgment upon the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\u00a0 The arbitrator will have the authority to award money damages (with interest on unpaid amounts from the date due), specific performance, and temporary injunctive relief, but not the authority to award exemplary or punitive damages, and any claimed right to such damages is expressly waived.\n\u00a0\nThe Hackathons and any dispute arising under or related to the Hackathons will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "The Grand Prize winner will
