Shinseki\u2019s goal of ending Veteran homelessness by 2015.\u00a0 Because JBJ Soul Kitchen has been intimately involved in the development to the project, because they do not have any pecuniary interest whatsoever in the outcome, nor will they gain from this voluntary affiliation, and because they serve Veterans as part of their \u201cneighbor in need\u201d population, we decided that it was an ideal venue for contestants to demonstrate their entries as a defined beta test site.\u00a0 VAi2 recognized that working closely with this private organization, rather than solely focusing on VA facilities, would benefit Veterans because homeless Veterans do not and should not exclusively use VA facilities; encouraging JBJ Soul Kitchen\u2019s close participation helps to emphasize the need to include private providers and would encourage software developers to include these organizations within their developed entries.\u00a0\nThe Project Real-time Electronic Access for Caregivers and the Homeless (REACH) contest is being sponsored by the Department of Veterans Affairs through the VA Innovation Initiative, in support of the Administration\u2019s goal to end Veteran homelessness by 2015.\u00a0 This is an apps-development challenge to help the people who help the homeless more easily find essential services.\u00a0 It is designed to tap the enormous talent and deep compassion of the nation\u2019s developer community.\u00a0 Winners of this contest will deliver a free, easy-to-use, and broadly accessible web and smartphone application that provides locality-based information about shelters, clinics, and food banks.\u00a0 This contest has the potential to advance the mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs by providing technological support to those who help homeless Veterans.\u00a0 While emphasizing Veterans, however, VA believes all persons experiencing homelessness or providing care to the homeless would benefit from an application that provides better access and information to healthcare, employment, and counseling services. \u00a0\nFinalists will develop applications which provide users with easy access to resources near JBJ Soul Kitchen (Red Bank, NJ).\u00a0 This contest is designed to expand the help that this provider of services to the homeless \u2013 and other similar organizations across the country \u2014 can offer by providing easy access to up-to-date information about local resources.\u00a0 Finalists in this competition must at a minimum provide real- or near real-time information about bed availability among area homeless shelters near JBJ Soul Kitchen.\nThe ultimate goal of this contest is to create a national platform that can be adapted to any location in America to support those who help the homeless rapidly identify points of service, including food, shelter and medical clinics.\u00a0\nContest Requirements and Rules\n1.\u00a0Subject of the contest.\u00a0 The goal of the contest is to create a free, easy-to-use, and broadly accessible web- and smartphone app to provide locality-based services available to the homeless, including shelters, health clinics, and food banks.\n2.\u00a0Amount of the prize.\u00a0 VA will award up to $10,000 to as many as five finalists.

Documentation provided as part of the entry must include any important additional information, such as system requirements.\u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0Unlike the previous round of competition, delivering a

3.a.\nd.\u00a0Demonstrate to the satisfaction of the judges that the application excels in areas of performance speed, ease of use, comprehensive service delivery to support those who help the

of a tie for the fifth position based on submission time, the competition judges will review the tying applications to determine if they meet the requirements listed in 3a.\u00a0 If both applications are found to meet the eligibility criteria, the contest will expand to accommodate a sixth finalist.\u00a0 The fifth and sixth finalist will each receive a $10,000 prize.\u00a0 They will each, however, only get one round of beta testing days, instead of two, to be decided at random.\n\u2022\u00a0In the unlikely event that more than two competitors tie and all entrants meet the selection criteria, the judges will select two finalists at random.\u00a0 The selected finalists will each receive a $10,000 prize and one round of beta testing, to be decided at random.\n7.\u00a0Decisions to
