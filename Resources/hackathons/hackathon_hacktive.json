If you sign up as an individual, but would prefer to participate on a team, use the forum to connect with others and get inspired. Join in the discussion, share ideas, and find people that may be interested in the same ideas and want to form a team.\u00a0Do I have to stay there for the entire time?You can come and go as you please, but all coding must be produced solely by team members, working on-site during the allotted hacking time.\n\nTeams must consist of between one and four participants. Teams must submit a list of members by 11:59PM on Friday, September 20th, and all modifications to team composition must be verified by ACTIVE Network organizers.", "hackathon-number-of-participants": "32", "hackathon-is-colocated": "True", "hackathon-has-ended": "False", "hackathon-number-of-judging-criteria": "5", "hackathon-requirements": "\nThe Judges shall be asked to consider five equally-weighted criteria when assessing each Entry and voting:\nIs the application polished, visually appealing, and easy to use?\nDoes the application take advantage of the unique functionality offered by the ACTIVE Network platform?\n\u00a0Is the application compelling and/or indispensable?\nHow well does the application help connect people with an active lifestyle?\n\u00a0Is the application unique and/or innovative?\n\u00a0\nYour submission should include an image and brief description of your application.

It's like a marathon workshop for developers, designers, and entrepreneurs! It's also about meeting and getting to know cool people in the local community while doing something fun.\n\nA laptop and charger is a good starting place. Bring a sleeping bag if you plan to sleep and any toiletries you may want to have on hand. Other than that, we provide food, facilities, power, and drinks.

You don\u2019t need to have ever attended a hackathon before to participate in HACKTIVE.\n\nDefinitely. We\u2019ll provide food throughout the event at no cost to participants, from more substantial meals to snacks for munching and code-crunching. Plenty of beverages will be provided during the competition as well, with no shortage of energy drinks! If you have a specific food allergy or other specific need, contact us and we'll try to find a way to make it work for you.\n\nCheck-in will start at 10am on Saturday morning. The event doesn\u2019t officially kick off until 11:30am, but come early if you want to set up a specific hacking spot for your team, as this will be determined on a first come, first serve basis.\n\nThere won\u2019t be any officially designated sleeping area, however there will be plenty of benches, seats, and beanbag chairs throughout if you want to catch some Z\u2019s a quiet corner.\n\nNo. All code must have been produced solely by team members, working on-site, after 12:00PM on Saturday, September 21st.

Demos should be no longer than 3 minutes. Demos take place in two rounds. Teams will be placed in one of three groups for the first round. The top fifteen teams will constitute the teams in the second round. First round demos will be three minutes of presentation. Second round demos will consist of three minutes of presentation and then two minutes of Q&A.\n\nA panel of industry judges will judge the apps based on five equally-weighted criteria: Design, Effective use of the ACTIVE Network platform, Utility, Relevancy to the theme, and Originality of concept, each scored on a 10 point scale.
