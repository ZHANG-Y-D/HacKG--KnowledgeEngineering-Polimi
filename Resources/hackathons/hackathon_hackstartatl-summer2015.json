If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).\nParticipants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.\nAs this is a hackathon we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our hackathon are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.\nSponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.\nIf you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of hackathon staff immediately.\nHackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.\nIf a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the hackathon.\nWe expect participants to follow these rules throughout the entirety of HackStart Summer 2015.", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "First Place"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Second Place"}, {"prize-content": "This prize goes to the hack that has the largest helpful social impact on society.", "prize-title": "Social Impact"}, {"prize-content": "This prize goes to the hack that best addresses the problem that it's trying to solve.", "prize-title": "Problem Solving"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=3405 Piedmont Road Northeast, Atlanta, GA 30305, USA", "hackathon-url": "https://hackstartatl-summer2015.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": "This goes to the hack that has that best improves the community in the most impactful way.\n**This is its own award."}, {"judging-criterion": "How original is the idea?
