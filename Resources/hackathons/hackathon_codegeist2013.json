To enter, you must:\u00a0 (a) submit your add-on to the \n, making sure to check the \"Codegeist Entry\" box and (2) enter your submission on ChallengePost with your name, your add-on's name, and the plugin key from your atlassian-plugin.xml file.\n5. Six prizes will be awarded:\n6. We will evaluate all entries and notify the winners via email by June 30, 2013.\u00a0\n7. When choosing prize winners, judges will consider three criteria:\n\u00a0\nCodegeist (\"Competition\") is a skills-based competition aimed at encouraging the development of innovative and creative plugins, integrations, extensions, web apps, mobile apps, and CLI tools that work with Atlassian's products (each, an \u201cAdd-On\u201d) and making these Add-Ons available into the \n. Prizes will be awarded to those eligible Contestants who submit the winning Entries. No purchase is necessary to enter or win.\nThe Competition is sponsored by Atlassian Pty Ltd (ABN 53 102 443 916) of Level 6, 341 George Street, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia.\u00a0 The Administrator for the Competition is ChallengePost, Inc., a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at 425 W. 13th Street, Suite #504, New York, NY 10014 (\u201cChallengePost\u201d). The Administrator is responsible for supporting and hosting the Competition website, administering payment of Prizes, and is the official Competition timekeeper. The Sponsor is responsible for these Competition Rules and the application thereof, including but not limited to determining qualified entries and judging.\nIn order to enter the Competition, a Contestant must agree to these Competition Rules (the \"Rules\"). Therefore, please read these Rules carefully prior to Entry to ensure you understand and agree with them. You are not required to agree to these Rules (as you may elect not to participate in the Competition), but no one may submit an Entry to be eligible for any prizes in the Competition without agreeing to be bound by these Rules. Each Contestant (including each member of any team or Business Entity Contestant) shall be deemed to agree to these Rules, and shall be considered to enter into a legally binding agreement with Atlassian, by submitting an Entry for the Competition, or by clicking a box indicating agreement to be bound by these Rules. Note that capitalized words used in these Rules have the meaning ascribed to them in these Rules.\nIn these Rules, we refer to someone who submits an entry for the Competition as a Contestant. At the time of submitting an Entry, we ask that the individual, team, or business submitting the Entry identify the individual(s) associated with the Entry, and provide the information required by these Rules. A Contestant may submit more than one Entry (though Contestants cannot submit the same Add-On (even different versions of the same Add-On) more than once).\u00a0 Contestants may participate individually or as part of a team or business and may compete for each prize they are qualified to win (as described below). We regret that we must exclude certain individuals from eligibility as a Contestant, including those Ineligible Persons described below.\n5.1If a Contestant enters as part of a team, the Contestant understands and agrees that, in order for his or her team to be eligible to participate, all of the members of the team must register and accept the Rules. The Contestants assume the responsibility for identifying each member of a team at the time the team submits its Entry, and Atlassian does not assume any responsibility for checking the identification of team members. The members of a team that are identified with the submission of an Entry shall be final and that team may not add, remove or substitute members, or otherwise change the composition of the team, for the duration of the Competition. Furthermore, a Contestant that is part of a team understands and agrees that if his or her team is selected to receive a prize, each Contestant on the team is responsible for ensuring the prize is appropriately distributed to each member of the team. Finally, in order to remain eligible to win a prize, the team and each member of that team must satisfy the eligibility requirements in these rules, including the submission of a Contest Prize Validation Agreement (discussed below); if one member of the team does not comply with these Rules or is disqualified, the team as a whole will be disqualified.\n5.2Atlassian encourages entries from businesses and other legal entities. If an Entry is submitted on behalf of a corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other legal entity (any of which being referred to as a \"Business Entity\"), the Contestant(s) submitting the Entry hereby certifies to Atlassian that (1) the appropriate authorization from the corporate officers, executives, managers or other required persons or group has been obtained, (2) the individual Contestants are in some manner legally associated with the Business Entity, and (3) the individual accepting the Rules on behalf of the Business Entity is authorized to legally bind the Business Entity. A Business Entity submitting an Entry shall be legally bound by these Rules by the act of the Contestant(s) acting on its behalf. Each Contestant associated with or submitting an Entry for or on behalf of a Business Entity acknowledges and agrees that if the Contestant enters the Competition without obtaining the requisite authorization, Atlassian may, in its sole discretion, disqualify the Contestant and the Business Entity and any submitted Entry. Finally, if a Business Entity is selected to receive a prize, a corporate officer or other authorized person entitled to bind the Business Entity will be required to execute and deliver the Contest Prize Validation Agreement on behalf of the Business Entity.\nA submission by a Contestant must satisfy the following requirements in order to qualify as an \u201cEntry\u201d for the Developer Competition:\n6.1The complete Entry must be submitted by 6:00pm Pacific Daylight Time on May 31, 2013 (the \u201cCompetition Entry Deadline\u201d).\n6.2Entries must be submitted as follows:\u00a0 Contestants must (a) publish the Add-on in the \n, making sure to check the \"Codegeist Entry\" box and (b) enter the submission on the Competition Entry page with the Contestant(s) name, the Add-On name, and the plugin key from the atlassian-plugin.xml file.\u00a0\n6.3Each Contestant must provide the registration information required at the Competition Entry page, including a valid working email address. The contact person for the Competition for such Entry will be the authorized account holder of the email address provided at the time of Entry. The \"authorized account holder\" is the natural person assigned to an email address by the provider of such email service. (Please note the provisions of these Rules relating to Atlassian\u2019s collection and use of submitted registration information, below.)\n6.4The submitted application must be an original work of the Contestant that is an Add-On to an Atlassian product that uses an Atlassian product API (available on \n).\u00a0 The submitted application (by itself or as part of another application) cannot have been publicly available in the \n prior to February 1, 2013.\u00a0 In addition, any application with respect to which Atlassian has provided any substantial development assistance is ineligible. Any determination as to whether an application is ineligible under this section of the Rules will be made by Atlassian in its sole discretion and will be final and binding.\n6.5The submitted application must be executable so that the Judges may evaluate it through use with an Atlassian product.\u00a0\n6.6A submitted application must, at a minimum, support English language use but may also support other languages at the discretion of the Contestant.\n6.7No application (even different versions of the same application) may be submitted more than once. \u00a0\n6.8An application that contains (1) sexual, violent, abusive, harassing, offensive or insulting content or (2) enables or promotes any illegal activity or (3) infringes any other party\u2019s legal rights may be disqualified. All determinations regarding compliance with these content policies or any disqualification hereunder will be made at Atlassian\u2019s sole discretion and will be final and binding.\nAfter the Competition Entry Deadline, all eligible Entries will be subject to judging in order to determine the prize winners.\n7.1The judges for the Competition shall consist of a panel of Atlassian employees and others selected by Atlassian (the \u201cJudges\u201d).\n7.2The Judges shall be asked to consider three equally-weighted criteria when assessing each Entry and voting:\nThe decision of the Judges is final and binding.\u00a0 We reserve the right to not choose a winner for a category.\n7.3We will notify winners on or before June 30, 2013 via email, U.S. mail, or telephone.\u00a0 We will post the names of the winners on the Competition website hosted by ChallengePost once we have confirmed each winner\u2019s eligibility.\u00a0 A winners list will also be posted on \n. \u00a0\n8.1Atlassian will award the following prizes:\n(a)one (1) Best Add-On of the Month (February) in the amount of Ten Thousand United States Dollars (US$10,000);\n(b)one (1) Best Add-On of the Month (March) in the amount of Ten Thousand United States Dollars (US$10,000);\n(c)one (1) Best Add-On of the Month (April) in the amount of Ten Thousand United States Dollars (US$10,000);\n(d)one (1) Best Add-On of the Month (May) in the amount of Ten Thousand United States Dollars (US$10,000);\n(e)one (1) Best Stash Add-On Month in the amount of Ten Thousand United States Dollars (US$10,000); and\n(f)one (1) Best Add-On Overall in the amount of Fifteen Thousand United States Dollars (US$15,000).\n8.2Best Add-On Overall will be selected by the Judges from among the winners of the Best Add-On of the Month.\u00a0 An Entry could win both Best Stash Add-On and Best Overall Add-On.\n8.3All Prizes are contingent on Contestant's compliance with these Rules.\n8.4Atlassian is not responsible for decisions on the division or distribution of any prize among or between team members or Business Entities. Instead, the decision on how to distribute or divide any prize among individual team members or within Business Entities is the sole responsibility of the participating team or Business Entity. Each Contestant hereby expressly waives any claim they may have against Atlassian relating to the division of any prize among team members or Business Entities and expressly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Atlassian from and against any and all claims relating to such allocation of prizes and agrees that Atlassian may offset against the amount of any prize to be awarded the amount of costs incurred by Atlassian, including any legal or other professional fees, arising from or relating to any such claim or dispute.\n8.5The payment to potential prize recipients is subject to the express requirement that the Contestant submit to Atlassian (or ChallengePost on behalf of Atlassian) all documentation requested by Atlassian (or ChallengePost on behalf of Atlassian) to permit it to comply with all applicable United States, state, local and foreign (including provincial) tax reporting and withholding requirements. Any prize will be net of any taxes Atlassian may be required to withhold (and Atlassian may rely upon the advice of its accountants to determine withholding, which decision shall be final and binding). The winning Contestant(s) shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with all the applicable tax laws and filing requirements and the payment of all taxes that may be assessed against the Contestant on account of their receipt of a prize. If a Contestant fails to comply with the requirements of these Rules, the right to receive the prize may be forfeited, and Atlassian may, in its sole discretion, select an alternative prize recipient.\n8.6Actual odds of winning depend on the number of eligible entries received.\u00a0 Atlassian cannot accurately predict the number of entrants who will participate in the Competition. \u00a0\nAll Contestants who are selected to receive a prize will be required to complete and enter into a Contest Prize Validation Agreement or other documents prior to being identified as a winner or receiving a prize. The Contest Prize Validation Agreement will contain (i) an affidavit as to the requirements for eligibility in the Competition, (ii) a publicity release providing Atlassian the right to use the Contestant\u2019s name or likeness on Atlassan websites, the Competition website hosted by ChallengePost, and in related media promoting Atlassian, including the Competition, (iii) an indemnification agreement relating to any breach of warranties made by Contestant under these Rules and (iv) such other provisions that may be required to comply with laws applicable to the awarding of the prize, including tax requirements. If a team or Business Entity is selected as a potential prize recipient, all members of the team or a person with the authority to bind the Business Entity, must enter into the Contest Prize Validation Agreement, which will also provide how the prize should be awarded. Failure to comply with this requirement or to submit any of these documents within the time period specified in an email from Atlassian (or ChallengePost on behalf of Atlassian) providing the Agreement may mean that the Entry will no longer be eligible to win the applicable prize and Atlassian may, in its sole discretion, select an alternative Contestant to receive the prize.\nAs between Atlassian and the Contestant, the Contestant retains ownership of all intellectual property rights in and to the Entry, including the right to offer and distribute the application commercially, except for the license rights granted in these Rules. In order for an application to be eligible as an Entry, each Contestant submitting the application must, and hereby does, grant Atlassian a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, free and non-exclusive license to (i) use, reproduce, publicly perform and publicly display the material that Contestant submits to this Competition for the purposes of allowing Atlassian to use, test and evaluate the Entry for purposes of the Competition, to administer the technical and other requirements of the Competition, and to advertise, display, demonstrate or otherwise promote the Competition, the Atlassian Marketplace and Atlassian. Contestant specifically agrees that Atlassian shall have the right to use, reproduce, publicly perform and publicly display the Entry in connection with the advertising and promotion of the Competition, the Atlassian Marketplace and Atlassian via communication to the public or other groups, including, without limitation, the right to make screenshots, animations and video clips available for promotional purposes. Contestant also hereby grants to the Judges a limited, non-exclusive, free and worldwide license to install, perform, display and use the Entry on any compatible computing device. Contestant may not charge a fee for the download of an Entry by Atlassian or the Judges.\nEach Contestant hereby grants Atlassian the right to use, publicly display, publish and reproduce, for all purposes, including publicity, promotion and advertising, in any media, online or offline, Contestant\u2019s name, city, state and country of residence, voice, photograph, likeness and image, including any video and other images and audio files submitted by Contestant or obtained by Atlassian, and create, use, publish and reproduce derivative works thereof (collectively, \u201cPublicity Materials\u201d). Contestant hereby waives any right Contestant may have to inspect or approve the Publicity Materials, as used in connection with the Competition or any related advertising, and any and all right to receive compensation of any kind on account of such use based on claims of the Contestant as to the rights of privacy, publicity, notoriety or any other rights arising out of or relating to any use by Atlassian of the Contestant\u2019s name, likeness or appearance, or the content of their Entry.\n12.1Administrator collects personal information from you when you enter the Competition.

By accepting a prize, a Contestant (including each member of a team or Business Entity) agrees and consents to Atlassian and its agencies\u2019 use of the Contestant\u2019s name and/or likeness to identify the party submitting the prize-winning Entry a reasonable time after completion of the Competition in promotional and advertising materials of Atlassian (and its partners, contractors and agents) as a winner of the Competition, without additional compensation, unless prohibited by law.

A Contestant may be prohibited from participating in this Competition if, in either Atlassian's sole discretion or Administrator\u2019s sole discretion, either reasonably believes that the Contestant has attempted to undermine the legitimate operation of the Competition by cheating, deception or other unfair voting or other practices or annoys, abuses, threatens or harasses any other Contestants, Atlassian, Administrator or the Judges.\n21.2You acknowledge and understand that Atlassian, its business partners and others may independently develop applications that may be similar to or identical to your Entry in terms of idea, functionality or in other respects.
