{"hackathon-description-text": "\nWelcome to the Disrupt SF 2015 Hackathon! Our Hackathons are crazy, exciting, exhausting events where hundreds of coders and developers come together to form teams which have just shy of 24hours to build something amazing from the ground up.", "hackathon-number-of-prizes": "36", "hackathon-id": "disruptsf2015", "hackathon-judges": [{"judge-role": "", "judge-name": "An Awesome Panel of Judges"}], "hackathon-number-of-judges": "1", "hackathon-eligibility": "", "hackathon-number-of-participants": "597", "hackathon-is-colocated": "True", "hackathon-has-ended": "True", "hackathon-number-of-judging-criteria": "1", "hackathon-requirements": "", "hackathon-rules": "\n\nThis is, by all means, the most important rule. This is a very diverse environment, made up of many races, religions, sexual orientations, genders, and gender identities. Any behavior or presentation that objectifies or belittles others will be halted, with the presenters immediately disqualified and removed from the event. Don\u2019t behave in a way or present anything you wouldn\u2019t be proud to have your parents see. For more information surrounding our policies on harassment, please\u00a0\n.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a Powerpoint-athon! Build and demonstrate a working project, don\u2019t just show us screenshots and slides.\n\nThe project you present must be coded entirely during the Hackathon. The only exceptions are for publicly available frameworks/APIs and open-source code that has been available for at least a month. If it feels shady to use the code, don\u2019t.\n\nFinalists will have their code audited to make sure it\u2019s all new and legit, by a developer appointed by TechCrunch. Your code belongs to you and we won\u2019t share it with anyone, but we will want to see it if you win.\n\nUse Git or an equivalent to track your code as you write it. It\u2019s good practice, and if it comes down to an audit, it\u2019ll help you prove your code is new.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an opportunity to promote your team\u2019s pre-existing product. Don\u2019t tack one tiny feature onto your existing product and call it a day.\n\nYou must present your hack as described in your submission \u2013 if you deviate from your accepted submission, we\u2019ll have to boot you from the stage. Don\u2019t submit one thing and then abuse the stage and respect of the audience to present something different.\n\nWe\u2019re limiting the number of members per team at 5, in the interest of keeping things fair. All other things equal, it\u2019s not very reasonable for a team of 2 or 3 to compete against a team of 20.\nAlso, we strongly suggest that each hacker gives their attention to just one team, rather than trying to be a part of multiple projects; we want to see your best work, and it\u2019s hard to do your best work when you\u2019re jumping from table to table.", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Disrupt SF 2015 Overall Winner"}, {"prize-content": "First Prize $5,000", "prize-title": ".CLUB Domains"}, {"prize-content": "Second Prize $1000", "prize-title": ".CLUB Domains"}, {"prize-content": "1st place $3,000", "prize-title": "abbvie"}, {"prize-content": "2nd place $1,500", "prize-title": "abbvie"}, {"prize-content": "3rd place $500", "prize-title": "abbvie"}, {"prize-content": "$1000", "prize-title": "CircleCI"}, {"prize-content": "$5000", "prize-title": "Clover Network, Inc"}, {"prize-content": "The best at integrating SYNC 3's capacitive touchscreen, improved voice recognition, and image display capabilities could win a 2 year lease on a SYNC 3 equipped Ford vehicle or a trip to Las Vegas for the 2016 CES to showcase their app on stage with Ford", "prize-title": "Ford Motor Comapany"}, {"prize-content": "1st place $3000", "prize-title": "Magnet"}, {"prize-content": "2nd place $1500", "prize-title": "Magnet"}, {"prize-content": "3rd place $500", "prize-title": "Magent"}, {"prize-content": "Club Sportiva Exotic Car Tour for up to five people.
