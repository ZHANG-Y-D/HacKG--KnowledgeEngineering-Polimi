Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any hackathon venue, including hacks, talks, workshops, parties, social media and other online media. Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon without a refund (if applicable) at the discretion of the hackathon organisers.\nWhilst the event will be an opportunity to apply what you've learnt from browsing APIs prior to the event, the event will be relying on you commencing coding only from the Friday Pitch night. The only exception to this rule is if it's been made Open Source, freely available for use by other teams and in piublic-domain. Prior to the event, feel free to fill your boots with learning about relevant libraries like Atlassian Connect, HealthKit/ResearchKit, BlueMix etc, all of which will help you once the event kicks off and perhaps give you the edge you need. But don't pre-build - if we detect it, your entry will be jeopardised.",
