You are also required to \n\u00a0to submit and be eligible for event prizes.\n\nOur goal is to ensure that all participants can freely and openly share ideas in a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment that encourages and inspires mutual respect and collaboration. The purpose of this document is not to restrict the diversity of ideas and expression in the community; rather, it\u2019s to raise awareness of the potential for actions that could alienate valuable members \u2014 and potential members \u2014 of the community.\nHACKAKL is an event that attracts diverse people from a wide variety of ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds. We acknowledge that cross-cultural communication can often be complicated and encourage everyone to consider both the impact of their actions on those with different backgrounds and experiences and the honest intentions of those who may have unknowingly caused offense. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.\nOne of the greatest strengths of the civic hackathon community is inclusiveness. Making all attendees feel welcome and included at HACKAKL is everyone\u2019s job.\nSponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other participants should strive to treat all people with dignity and respect, regardless of their culture, religion, physical appearance, disability, race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation.\nCollaboration is central to the hackathon and to the larger open government and open source community. This collaboration involves individuals working with others in teams, teams working with each other, and individuals and teams working with other projects outside. This collaboration reduces redundancy, and improves the quality of our work. Internally and externally, we should always be open to collaboration. If and when misunderstandings occur, we encourage people to work things out between themselves whenever possible. People are encouraged to take responsibility for their words and actions and listen to constructively-presented criticism with an open mind, courtesy, and respect.\nIf people are unable to work out issues between themselves, they are encouraged to seek the advice of a mutually trusted third party or an event organizer.\nNobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect. Asking questions can help prevent problems down the road, and so questions are encouraged. Those who are asked questions should be responsive and helpful. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.\nIf you feel threatened or violated as a result of intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct, please immediately notify an event organizer. Likewise, please immediately notify an event organizer if you notice that someone else is being subjected to such behavior.\nThe HACKAKL team wants everyone to feel safe for the duration of the event. If necessary, conference staff are empowered to take appropriate actions that may include, but are not limited to, warnings, expulsion from the event, and referrals to venue security or local law enforcement. We\u2019re all in this together. Thanks for making HACKAKL great for everyone!
