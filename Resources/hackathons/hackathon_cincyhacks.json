{"hackathon-description-text": "\nThere\u2019s an astounding lack of high school hackathons in the Midwest, much less the greater Cincinnati area. Collegiate hackathons may be more widespread, but the thought of competing against older and seemingly smarter college students pushes these talented high school minds away. CincyHacks, however, aims to change this. In fact, CincyHacks is the first of its kind, drawing talented high school students from all over the tri-state area as Cincinnati\u2019s first high school hackathon. The goal is to foster a tech culture for high school students in greater Cincinnati communities\u00a0and provide an engaging environment and platform for them to showcase their awesome hacks.", "hackathon-number-of-prizes": "7", "hackathon-id": "cincyhacks", "hackathon-judges": [{"judge-role": "University of Cincinnati", "judge-name": "Dr. John Franco"}, {"judge-role": "Cengage Learning", "judge-name": "James Carman"}, {"judge-role": "GE Aviation", "judge-name": "Chuck Kulchar"}, {"judge-role": "Cengage Learning", "judge-name": "Matt Tower"}], "hackathon-number-of-judges": "4", "hackathon-eligibility": "", "hackathon-number-of-participants": "53", "hackathon-is-colocated": "True", "hackathon-has-ended": "True", "hackathon-number-of-judging-criteria": "4", "hackathon-requirements": "", "hackathon-rules": "", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "Each team member will receive an Oculus Rift VR headset and an engraved first place medal.
