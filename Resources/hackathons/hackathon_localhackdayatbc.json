{"hackathon-description-text": "\nLocal Hack Day is a 12-hour hackathon with a liberal arts spin. The main goal of this hackathon is to provide students with space where they can use technology to solve problems that they face every day. Whether this means using the concepts they learned in class to apply them to a project or learning a completely new technology for the day, we want participants to have the resources and environment they need to innovate in their highest capacity. Projects can be in the form of a website, mobile app, hardware hack, or anything that involves coding/technology.", "hackathon-number-of-prizes": "1", "hackathon-id": "localhackdayatbc", "hackathon-judges": [{"judge-role": "", "judge-name": "John Abreu"}, {"judge-role": "", "judge-name": "Jacob Shafer"}], "hackathon-number-of-judges": "2", "hackathon-eligibility": "", "hackathon-number-of-participants": "5", "hackathon-is-colocated": "True", "hackathon-has-ended": "False", "hackathon-number-of-judging-criteria": "5", "hackathon-requirements": "", "hackathon-rules": "", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "Winning team wins an Amazon Echo Dot!!!", "prize-title": "Grand Prize"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=Fulton Hall, 255 Grapevine Rd, Wenham, MA 01984, USA", "hackathon-url": "https://localhackdayatbc.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}], "hackathon-location-address": "Fulton Hall, 255 Grapevine Rd, Wenham, MA 01984, USA", "hackathon-description-header": "Build solutions that solve a problem that college students face day to day!", "hackathon-prizes-total": "$50", "hackathon-location-description": "Boston College - Fulton Hall", "hackathon-end-date": "", "has-projects": "False"}
