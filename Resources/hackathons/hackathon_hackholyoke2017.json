Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable at an officially sanctioned MLH event, if the event itself is creating an unsafe or inappropriate environment, or if interacting with a MLH representative or event organizer makes you uncomfortable, please report it using the procedures included in this\ndocument.\nMajor League Hacking stands for inclusivity. We believe that every single person has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment.\nHarassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual\nimages in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and\nunwelcome sexual attention. If what you\u2019re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.\nParticipants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.\nSponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, MLH staff and anyone else at the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the event. Booth staff(including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise\ncreate a sexualised environment.\nIf a participant engages in harassing behavior, Major League Hacking may take any action MLH deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type.\nIf you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Major League Hacking using the reporting procedures defined below.\nMLH representatives will be happy to help participants contact campus security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.\nWe expect participants to follow these rules at all hackathon venues, online interactions in relation to the event, hackathon-related social events, and on hackathon supplied transportation.\nReporting Procedures\nIf you feel uncomfortable or think there may be a potential violation of the code of conduct,\nplease report it immediately using one of the following methods.
