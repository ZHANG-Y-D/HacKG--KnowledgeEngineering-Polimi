A PURCHASE OR PAYMENT OF ANY KIND WILL NOT INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF WINNING.\nMTA App Quest (the \u201cCompetition\u201d) is an MTA competition challenging the software development community and the public to create new software applications using MTA data. The Competition is intended to provide recognition to individuals and teams consisting of individuals, for-profit legal entities and/or non-profit organizations (collectively, \u201cContestants\u201d) for developing innovative apps that utilize MTA data available at \n (\u201cMTA Data\u201d). The MTA\u2019s goals for the Competition are to: (1) stimulate the creation of new apps that enhance the transportation experience of MTA\u2019s customers; (2) raise awareness of MTA data; and (3) promote additional MTA engagement with third-party software developers. The Competition is being administered for MTA by ChallengePost, Inc. (\u201cAdministrator\u201d).\n*The sections below provide more detailed information and additional requirements and restrictions.\nThe Competition for cash and in-kind prizes is open only to: (1) legal residents, 18 or older, of the fifty (50) United States and its territories; and (2) for-profit and non-profit legal entities that are domiciled in the United States that are in existence at the time of entry and employ fewer than fifty (50) people at the time of entry. If an entity employs 50 or more people, it may compete for the \u201cLarge Organization Recognition Award\u201d (see 5 below). If a submission is on behalf of a team, each member of the team must meet the applicable eligibility requirement. An individual or entity may submit one or more entries on its own behalf and, in addition, may be a member of one or more teams that submit other Applications.\nThe following persons and legal entities are not eligible to compete in the Competition: The judges, ChallengePost, Inc., advertising agencies, and any other company or individual involved with the design, production, execution, or distribution of the Competition, any person that is an MTA or MTA agency contractor or is employed by the MTA or an MTA agency contractor and is working on a project for the MTA or an MTA agency, any legal entity that is an MTA or MTA agency contractor, and any person or legal entity involved in any other situation where, in the MTA\u2019s sole judgment, it would be inappropriate for that person or legal entity to participate in the Competition. Any of the aforesaid person\u2019s\u00a0immediate family (spouse, parents and step-parents, siblings and step-siblings, and children and step-children) or household members (people who share the same residence at least three (3) months out of the year) are also not eligible to compete in the Competition.\nThe Competition is subject to New York laws and regulations and is void in any jurisdiction where such a competition is prohibited.\nBy creating a contest account, the Contestant unconditionally agrees to be bound by these Official Rules and that all MTA and Administrator decisions related to the Competition are final and binding. Eligibility to win a prize is contingent upon Contestant fulfilling all submission requirements and meeting the requirements for the prize.\nBetween July 11, 2011 at 10:00 AM ET and November 21, 2011 at 5:00 PM ET (the \u201cCompetition Submission Period\u201d).

Registered Contestants will then be able to enter a Submission. In the event of a dispute as to any registration, the authorized account holder of the email address used to register will be deemed to be the Contestant. The \u201cauthorized account holder\u201d is the natural person or legal entity assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Contestants generally and potential winners may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder. Contestants must comply with the terms of use of MTA Data and other intellectual property at \n. Failure to do so could result in disqualification from the Competition and, if applicable, revocation of a prize, at the sole discretion of the MTA and Administrator.\nEach Contestant is required to provide the following as part of the Submission:\nOnce a Contestant enters a Submission, the Submission cannot be modified in any way until after the Judging is complete.\nSubmissions will be posted on MTAAppQuest.com on a rolling basis after being screened by the Administrator for basic functionality, accuracy of messaging, and integrity (i.e., security), and appropriateness of content. The Administrator has the right to request access to the Application in person or via any reasonable manner to verify the Application functions and operates as stated in the Submission. Failure by a Contestant to honor such a request may result in immediate disqualification of the Submission. The members of the general public, including all Contestants will have equal access to Submissions posted on the website.\nNon-Contestants interested in the Competition may obtain updates on the competition and vote for their favorite Submissions as part of the Popular Choice Awards, by registering as a visitor on MTAAppQuest.com. Such registered visitors will be able to place one vote per day for each of their favorite Submissions\nThe public voting is tentatively scheduled to take place between November 30, 2011 at 10:00 AM ET and January 11, 2012 at 5:00 PM ET. Public voting will determine the winner of the Popular Choice Award Grand Prize and Popular Choice Award Second Prize. Each registered visitor is able to place one vote per day for each of their favorite Submissions. Use of an automated process or similar device to submit an electronic vote is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to circumvent the one-vote limit per Submission per day or to use any form of automated vote process will subject all votes from the person to disqualification. The MTA and/or Administrator reserves the right to disqualify any Contestant in their sole discretion, if a Contestant receives multiple and/or irregular votes from the same user or users, or receives votes in a manner that otherwise may indicate automated or non-automated vote manipulation. If the voting process for the Popular Choice Awards fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, the MTA and/or Administrator in their sole discretion reserves the right to use another means to determine the winner of the Popular Choice Awards. Contestants may not pay or otherwise compensate anyone or provide any other type of consideration, in exchange for votes.\nAny Contestant who, in the sole judgment of the MTA and Administrator, violates any prohibition in the rules will be disqualified.\nPublic votes may be displayed on the competition website, on a real-time basis, before being verified for integrity. These unverified votes will not necessarily reflect accurately the voting for the Popular Choice Awards.\nThe winners of the Popular Choice Awards will be determined on the basis of the verified vote counts, as determined by the MTA or Administrator. MTA and the Administrator reserve the right to extend the voting period at any time for any reason.\nSubmissions for the Large Organization Recognition Award are not eligible for the Popular Choice Awards.\nSubmissions will initially be screened by a Preliminary Panel of Judges selected by MTA and Administrator at their sole discretion.

MTA and Administrator reserve the right to substitute or modify the judging panels at any time for any reason.\nAll judges shall be and remain fair and impartial. Any judge may recuse him or herself from judging a Submission if the judge, the MTA or the Administrator considers that it is inappropriate, for any reason, for the judge to evaluate a specific Submission or group of Submissions.\nA Contestant\u2019s likelihood of winning will depend primarily on the number and quality of all of the Submissions, as determined by the Judges using the criteria below.
