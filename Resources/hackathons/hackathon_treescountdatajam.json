NYC Parks, with the assistance of BetaNYC, has turned this feedback and NYC Park\u2019s own questions into these Data Jam challenges.\nNow, we are asking you to help us make sense of the Census! \u00a0\n\n\nTreesCount! 2015 is the third decadal effort to completely inventory New York City\u2019s street trees! To date, 530,000 trees, representing approximately 80% of the City\u2019s streets, \n as part of the 2015 census, and NYC Parks is releasing all the data that has been reviewed to date. The Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island have all been completed. It is the most spatially accurate street tree dataset New Yorkers have ever seen. We need your help visualizing, comparing, and understanding changes across tree census datasets.\nBy building maps or visualizations, your goal is to help us begin to understand how changes in our urban forest affect NYC\u2019s neighborhoods.\nSample questions to explore:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Street Tree Census provides us with a wealth of data. Turning this into useful information through maps and visualizations helps us understand the urban forest. Maps and visualizations can help us build an understanding of this shared resource, and enable data-driven management decisions.\nYour goal is to make beautiful maps and visualizations that enable all types of New Yorkers to learn more about our urban forest.\nSample questions to explore:\n\nNYC\u2019s urban forest is an integral component of a healthy and equitable city. Understanding the urban forest\u2019s relationship to the City\u2019s health and economy will help urban forest stakeholders advocate for more resources to build a healthier and equitable city. Understanding these relationships will help demystify our urban forest\u2019s impact.\nYour goal is to use tree census data to help us understand our urban forest\u2019s relationship to specific environmental and economic indicators.\nSample questions to explore:\n\n\u00a0\nWith the 1995 and 2005 street tree censuses, NYC Parks has been able to catalyze major advances in urban forest management, making science-based operational decisions and quantify the benefits of the urban forest. In addition to understanding patterns in resource distribution and condition over time, long-term urban forest management decisions must consider factors such as climate change, pests, diseases, land use, and species diversity.\nYour goal is to help us explore these factors using census data and help us develop strategies to address the future of the urban forest.\nSample questions to explore:\n\n\u00a0\nTrees in urban settings face many challenges from both people and the environment. \u00a0We believe that tree stewardship by the community is an essential part of achieving our urban forestry goals. \u00a0Resources for tree care are finite, and so it is important that we better understand tree stewards and the challenges they face, and maximize the effectiveness of our volunteers by supporting their stewardship activity.\nYour goal is to explore Street Tree Census data to help develop insights that can measure the impact of stewardship on the health of our urban forest, and help us understand where stewardship efforts are most needed.\nSample questions to explore:\n\u00a0\nOur event is designed to foster meaningful collaboration between participants, community members, and government partners.\n\n\nThe organizers reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies not to participate in this event.
