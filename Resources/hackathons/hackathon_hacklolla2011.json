After you register you must verify your email address via the registration email sent to the email entered in the registration form. Registered Contestants will then be able to enter a Submission. In the event of a dispute as to any registration, the authorized account holder of the email address used to register will be deemed to be the Contestant\u2019s. The \u201cauthorized account holder\u201d is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Potential winners may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder. Registrants can receive the electronic credentials required to access an API Key from DoStuff Media by filling out the form at\u00a0\n. Access to the API using the electronic credentials can only be used for purposes of creating a Submission in this Challenge. Sponsor reserves the right to terminate a Submission\u2019s access to the API at any time. Contestants must comply with the DoStuff Media API Terms of Service. Failure to do so could result in disqualification from the Competition at the Sponsor\u2019s sole discretion.\nEach Contestant will be required to provide the following as part of the Submission:\nBy entering a Submission to the Competition, Contestants do NOT thereby transfer to Sponsor and/or Administrator or convey any right in or to the intellectual property rights of the Submissions to Sponsor and/or Administrator, but the Sponsor and Administrator will maintain a royalty free, non-exclusive license to, without limitation: a) Post the Submissions on \n; and b) Make the Submissions available for the course of the Competition and 12 months after the conclusion of the Competition Submission Period.\nOnce a Contestant enters a Submission, the Submission cannot be modified in any way until after the Judging Period is complete.\nSubmissions will be posted on \n on a rolling basis after being screened by the Administrator for basic functionality, accuracy of messaging, and integrity (i.e., security). The Administrator has the right to request access to the Application in person or via any reasonable manner to verify the Application functions and operates as stated in the Submission. Failure by a Contestant to honor such a request will subject the Submission to immediate disqualification. All Contestants will have equal access to Submissions posted on the website. Non-Contestants interested in the Competition are also encouraged to register on \n. Registration will be required in order to receive updates on the Competition and vote for the Popular Choice Award. Registered visitors will be able to vote for their favorite Submissions.\nBetween June 29, 2011 at 9:00 AM ET and July 10, 2011 at 5:00 PM ET registered users of \n may vote for their favorite Submissions. The Submission with the highest number of votes during this period will win the Popular Choice Award. Each registered user may vote for as many submissions as they like but no more than once for each Submission during the voting period. For purposes of this limitation, each day begins at 12:00 a.m. ET and ends at 11:59:59 p.m. ET on each calendar date during the voting period, with the exception of the first day, which begins at 9:00 a.m. ET, and the last day, which ends at 5:00 p.m. ET.\nUse of an automated process or similar device to submit an electronic vote is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to circumvent the vote limits or to use automated vote process will disqualify all votes from that registered user. If a Contestant receives multiple and/or irregular votes from the same user or users, including but not limited to, votes generated by a robotic, programmed, script, macro, other automated means or other source, the Sponsor and/or Administrator reserve the right to disqualify the Contestant in their sole discretion. If the voting process for the Popular Choice Award fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, the Sponsor and/or Administrator in their sole discretion reserve the right to use another means to determine the winner of the Popular Choice Award, i.e. random selection or appointing a panel of judges. Contestants may not pay people or provide any other type of consideration in exchange for votes. Any Contestant who violates the ban on paying or providing consideration in exchange for votes will be disqualified.\nPublic votes may be displayed on the competition website, on a real-time basis, before being verified for integrity. These unverified votes do not necessarily reflect accurately the winner of the Popular Choice Award. The winner of the Popular Choice Award will be the entrant(s) who is/are contacted directly by the Administrator or Sponsor after votes have been verified. Sponsor reserves the right to modify the voting period at anytime for any reason.\nSubmissions will initially be screened by a qualified internal panel selected by the Sponsor at its sole discretion. The internal panel will judge the Submissions on the criteria identified below to select finalist Submissions. Then the finalist Submissions will be judged by an expert judging panel determined by the Sponsor. Sponsor reserves the right to substitute or modify the judging panel at any time for any reason. Judges do have the right to withdraw without advance notice in the event of extenuating circumstances beyond their control. Judges will be fair and impartial. A judge may elect to recuse him or herself from judging a Submission, if in the judge\u2019s sole discretion it is not appropriate for him or her to judge that particular Submission because of a past or current relationship with that particular Contestant. A Submission will not be at a disadvantage if one or more judge recuses him or herself. Odds of winning depend on the number of eligible Submissions received and the quality of the Submissions. The approximate dates for the judging panel are between June 29, 2011 at 9:00 AM EST and July 10, 2011 at 5 PM EST.\nCriteria\nThe one (1) Contestant whose Submission earns the highest overall score will win the prizes identified below in section 7. In the event of a tie, winner will be selected based on the criteria described in (1), then (2), and finally (3).\nOne (1) winner will be based solely on the voting of registered visitors to \n. If there is a tie between one or more Submissions for the Popular Choice Award, the prize will be awarded to the Submission with the highest overall score from the judges.\nALL POTENTIAL COMPETITION WINNERS ARE SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION BY SPONSOR AND/OR ADMINISTRATOR WHOSE DECISIONS ARE FINAL AND BINDING IN ALL MATTERS RELATED TO THE COMPETITION.

If a potential winner of any prize cannot be contacted, fails to sign and return the affidavit of eligibility and liability/publicity release within the required time period (if applicable), or if the prize or prize notification is returned as undeliverable, potential winner forfeits prize. In the event that a potential winner of a Competition prize is disqualified for any reason, Sponsor may award the applicable prize to an alternate winner who had the highest score remaining of the eligible entries. If a winner is considered to be a minor is his or her state of residence, at Sponsor\u2019s sole option, the prize will either be awarded to the minor winner\u2019s parent or legal guardian on behalf of the winner, or the minor\u2019s parent or guardian will be required to ratify and sign the affidavit of eligibility, and liability/publicity release.\nFor Best Overall Application \u2013 Grand Prize: Flight tickets are not to exceed $1,000.
