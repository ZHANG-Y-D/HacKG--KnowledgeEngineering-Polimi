Knight Foundation (\u201cKnight Foundation\u201d) and the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d). \u00a0The goals of the Challenge are to: make local public information more personalized, usable, and accessible for all Americans; promote broadband adoption, particularly among Americans who are less likely to be regular Internet users (including low-income, rural, residents on Tribal lands, seniors, people with disabilities, and the low digital/English literacy communities); and create better links between Americans and services provided by local, state, Tribal and federal governments.\u00a0 The Challenge is intended to bring together providers of public data, developers, and traditionally underserved populations through a national contest for innovative uses of local data, and to provide recognition to contestants who develop software applications (apps) that provide easy access to relevant content with an emphasis on apps that use hyper-local and other public data from cities, counties, townships, Tribes and states.\nThe FCC seeks to promote broadband deployment and adoption for all Americans -- regardless of geography, race, economic status, disability, residence on Tribal land, or degree of digital or English literacy -- by providing easy access to relevant content.\u00a0 New applications can pull new users online, as well as increase the value of broadband connections for existing users. \u00a0Together, increased broadband adoption and deployment can be indispensable for unleashing innovation and investment, spurring job creation and economic growth, and ensuring our country's global competitiveness.\nConsistent with Knight Foundation\u2019s mission to foster informed and engaged communities and the FCC\u2019s goal to encourage broadband adoption and deployment, the FCC and Knight Foundation are co-sponsoring this Challenge, offering $100,000 in prizes.\u00a0 The Knight Foundation is the Challenge Administrator and has contracted with Clay Johnson and Fission Strategy to conduct this Challenge. While the Challenge is locally focused, the FCC and Knight Foundation want the apps created to be usable across jurisdictions throughout theUnited States.\n\n\nThe Challenge is open only to: (1) Citizens or permanent residents of the fifty (50) United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, who are at least thirteen (13) years old at the time of entry; and (2) private entities that are incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States, including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. An individual may participate on behalf of more than one team, corporation, or nonprofit organization. \u00a0Employees of the FCC, Knight Foundation and its contractors, Clay Johnson and Fission Strategy, and members of their immediate households, are not eligible.\u00a0 Federal entities and federal employees acting within the scope of their employment are not eligible. \u00a0Participation in this Challenge constitutes the Contestant's full and unconditional agreement to these official rules. \n\u00a0 Eligibility for a prize award is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements set forth herein.\n\nThe Challenge Submission Period begins on April 14, 2011 and ends at 11:59 EDT October 3, 2011 (the \"Challenge Submission Period\").\u00a0 The Challenge Administrator\u2019s computer, set to Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), is the official time-keeping device for this Challenge. \u00a0Entries may be submitted beginning at 12:00 AM on April 14, 2011 and must be received by October 3, 2011 11:59 PM EDT. \u00a0Winners will be announced on a date and time to be determined.\n\nRegistration is free.\u00a0 All entries must comply with the following submission requirements:\u00a0\nHow to submit your entry:\u00a0\nThe Challenge Submission Period begins on April 14, 2011 and ends at 11:59 EDT October 3, 2011 (the \"Challenge Submission Period\").\u00a0 The Challenge Administrator\u2019s computer, set to Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), is the official time-keeping device for this Challenge.\u00a0 \u00a0Entries may be submitted beginning at 12:00 AM on April 14, 2011 and must be received by October 3, 2011 11:59 PM EDT.\u00a0 Winners will be announced on a date and time to be determined.\nParticipants shall apply via the Challenge.gov portal (click the \u201cSubmissions\u201d tab above) and add a link to the fully functioning app or demonstration and your source code.\u00a0 To qualify, you need to build an application -- web, mobile, or text/SMS based -- that uses one of the OSI Approved open source licenses. \u00a0Any data source used must be publically available. \u00a0You will need to host your own application during the judging process and ensure that our panel of judges has easy access to your application (or, in the case of a mobile platform that the judges may not have access to, a demonstration of the working product).\u00a0\nRefer to the rules (click on Rules tab above) for important information regarding eligibility, prizes, and other requirements.\n\nSubmitted apps will be judged based on the following criteria:\n\nThe FCC and the Knight Foundation will announce judges to select the winners of the Challenge.\u00a0 A judge may not have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer, director, or agent of any entity that is a registered participant in a Challenge or have a familial or financial relationship with an individual who is a registered participant.\u00a0 Judges may be individuals from outside the FCC, the Knight Foundation or its contractors, including from the private sector.
