Posting of a Submission to the Competition Website does not constitute a final determination by the Sponsor that the Submission met requirements. Accordingly a Submission may still be disqualified even after it has been publically displayed.\u00a0\nA. All eligible Submissions will be judged by a panel of impartial judges (the \u201cJudges\u201d) selected by the Sponsor. Eligible Submissions may initially be screened by a qualified internal panel selected by the Sponsor at its sole discretion. The internal panel will judge these Submissions on the criteria identified in these Official Rules to select finalist Submissions. Finalist Submissions may then be judged by the judging panel determined by the Sponsor and identified on the Competition Website. The Sponsor reserves the right to substitute or modify the judging panel at any time for any reason.\u00a0\nB. All Judges shall be and remain fair and impartial. Any Judge may recuse him or herself from judging a Submission if the Judge or the Sponsor considers that it is inappropriate, for any reason, for the Judge to evaluate a specific Submission or group of Submissions.\u00a0\nC.

The two (2) Contestants whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores will become potential winners of the Prizes identified below in Section 13.\u00a0\nC. Tie Breakers. In the event of a tie between two or more Submissions, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first criterion listed above shall be deemed the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated by comparing the tied Submissions\u2019 scores on the second, and third criterion listed above, respectively. If two or more Submissions are tied on all three criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied submissions (the \u201cTie-Breaker Criteria\u201d).\nA. The public voting is scheduled to take place between July 9, 2013 at 10:00am Eastern Time, USA and July 19, 2013 at 5:00pm Eastern Time, USA (the \u201cVoting Period\u201d).

The Sponsor reserves the right to extend the Voting Period at any time for any reason.\nC. One (1) potential winners of the Popular Choice Award prize (described in Section 13 below) will be selected based solely on the highest number of votes received from Registered Visitors on the Competition Website.\u00a0 If there is a tie between or among two or more Submissions for the Popular Choice Award, the higher scoring Submission will be determined by the Tie-Breaker Criteria (described in Section 10(c) above).\nD. The likelihood of being selected to win the Popular Choice Award depends on the total number of verified votes received on the Submissions relative to other Contestants.\nE. Use of an automated process or similar device to submit an electronic vote is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to circumvent the one-vote limit per Submission, including the use of multiple email addresses or any form of automated vote processes will subject all votes from the person or entity to disqualification. The Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any Contestant at their sole discretion, if a Contestant receives multiple and/or irregular votes from the same user or users, or receives votes in a manner that otherwise may indicate automated or non-automated vote manipulation. If the voting process for the Popular Choice Award fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, the Sponsor at their sole discretion reserves the right to determine the winner by using non-suspect votes, or by any other means the Sponsor deems appropriate.\u00a0 If no alternative means of determining a winner of the Popular Choice Award is available, the Sponsor may eliminate the Popular Choice Award. Contestants may not pay or otherwise compensate anyone or provide any other type of consideration in exchange for votes.\nA.

At the sole discretion of the Sponsor, a potential winner will be deemed ineligible to win if:\u00a0\n(i) the potential winner (or in the case of a team, their Representative) cannot be contacted within ten (10) business days, or is contacted and refuses the Prize;\u00a0\u00a0\n(ii) the potential winner (or in the case of a team, their Representative or any participating member) fail(s) to sign and return the affidavit(s) of eligibility or a similar verification document and liability/publicity release(s) within ten (10) business days from receipt of such documents;\u00a0\u00a0\n(iii) the Prize or Prize notification is returned as undeliverable; or\u00a0\u00a0\n(iv) the Submission or the potential winner, or any member of a potential winner\u2019s team, is disqualified for any other reason.\u00a0 In the event of such disqualification, Sponsor at their sole discretion may award the applicable Prize to an alternate potential winner.

By entering, each Contestant (including, in the case of team, all participating members) agree(s) to:\u00a0\n(i) comply with and be bound by these Official Rules and the decisions of the Sponsor and/or the Competition judges which are binding and final in all matters relating to this Competition; and\u00a0\u00a0\n(ii) release, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sponsor, and their respective parent, subsidiary, and affiliated companies, the Prize suppliers and any other organizations responsible for sponsoring, fulfilling, administering, advertising or promoting the Competition, and all of their respective past and present officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives (hereafter the \u201cReleased Parties\u201d) from and against any and all claims, expenses, and liabilities (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees), including but not limited to negligence and damages of any kind to persons and property, defamation, slander, libel, violation of right of publicity, infringement of trademark, copyright or other intellectual property rights, property damage, or death or personal injury arising out of or relating to a Contestant\u2019s entry, creation of Submission or entry of a Submission, participation in the Competition, acceptance or use or misuse of the Prize (including any travel or activity related thereto) and/or the broadcast, transmission, performance, exploitation or use of Submission as authorized or licensed by these Official Rules.\u00a0\nC.
