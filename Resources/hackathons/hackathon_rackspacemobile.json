The Large Organization with the highest score will be selected as the potential winner of the Large Organization Recognition Award.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor each Prize listed in Section 7 below (with the exception of the Popular Choice Award), if two or more Submissions are tied, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first applicable criterion listed above will be considered the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions\u2019 scores on the next applicable criterion in the list above. If two or more Submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Submissions and the Submission receiving the most votes will be considered to be the higher scoring Submission.\nIn addition to the above, all eligible Submissions, with the exception of Submissions submitted by Large Organizations, will be evaluated by members of the public to determine which Submission is eligible to receive the Popular Choice Award. A Submission is eligible to win both a Popular Choice Award and one of the \u201cBest Overall App\u201d prizes.\nDuring the Voting Period, all eligible Submissions (excluding Submissions from Large Organizations) will be posted to the Challenge Website consistent with the license provisions outlined in Section 5 above.

Poster reserves the right, in its sole and unfettered discretion, to nullify all votes obtained via such means and to disqualify responsible Makers from further voting or participation in the Challenge. Makers may not directly or indirectly offer or pay any monetary or other form of consideration in exchange for a vote.\nEach person is limited to one vote per Submission and may only vote using one ChallengePost account.

You must have a valid ChallengePost account (that is linked to a valid email address) to vote. Votes from invalid, non-working, or inactive Challenge Post accounts or email addresses will be disqualified. The Poster and Administrator are not responsible for, and are not required to count any vote which, in their judgment, is incomplete, late, misdirected, damaged, unlawful or illicit. This includes votes secured in breach of the voting rules above, as well as those lost for technical reasons, or otherwise in violation of the ChallengePost Terms of Service or these Official Rules.\nIf there is a tie between two or more Submissions for the highest number of votes for Popular Choice Award, the potential winner will be determined by the Poster, at its sole discretion. If the voting process fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, the Poster has the right to determine any public voting prize winners by using non-suspect votes, or by any other means they deem appropriate.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe potential winners of each of the above-listed prizes will be contacted using the information associated with the ChallengePost account used to enter. Winning a prize is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements set forth herein. If a potential winner does not respond within 72 hours after the first attempt after notification of winning status, that potential winner will be deemed to have forfeited the prize, and the Submission with the next highest number of points or votes (as applicable) for that particular prize will be selected as an alternate potential winner in his/her place. If no Maker claims a prize, Poster will select an alternate potential winner at random from all eligible entries received for that prize, subject to any limitations set forth in these Official Rules. Any alternate potential winner will also have 72 hours to claim the prize, and must satisfy all eligibility requirements.\nPOTENTIAL WINNER IS SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION BY POSTER, WHOSE DECISIONS ARE FINAL AND BINDING IN ALL MATTERS RELATED TO THE CHALLENGE. A MAKER IS NOT A WINNER OF ANY PRIZE UNLESS AND UNTIL MAKER\u2019S ELIGIBILITY HAS BEEN VERIFIED AND MAKER HAS BEEN NOTIFIED THAT VERIFICATION IS COMPLETE. Except where legally prohibited, each Eligible Individual winner and/or the Representative for each winner will be required to complete and return, within seven (7) days of being notified, an Affidavit of Eligibility, Liability & Publicity Release and any applicable tax forms (\u201cRequired Forms\u201d) in order to claim a prize. If a winner fails to respond within 72 hours, fails to sign a return the Affidavit of Eligibility, Liability & Publicity Release within the required time period (if applicable), or in the event that a potential winner is disqualified for any reason, the potential winner will be deemed to have forfeited the prize, and the Maker with the next highest number of votes for the applicable prize category will be selected as an alternate potential winner. Noncompliance with the foregoing, failure to abide by these Official Rules, or return of the prize notification as non-deliverable may result in disqualification and naming of an alternate potential winner. Only three (3) alternate winner selections will be made for each prize, after which any remaining prizes will remain un-awarded. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nPrizes cannot be substituted, assigned, or transferred; however, the Poster has the right to make a prize substitution of equivalent or greater value at its sole discretion. Poster will not replace any lost or stolen prizes or components of a prize(s). Only the number of prizes stated in these Official Rules is available to be won in the Challenge. If, by reason of a print or other error, more prizes are claimed than the number set forth in these Official Rules, an alternate winner will be selected in accordance with the winner selection method described above from among all eligible claimants making purportedly valid claims to award the advertised number of prizes available. The Poster will not award a prize if there are no eligible Submissions entered in the Challenge, or if there are no eligible Makers or Submissions for a specific Prize Category.\nPrizes will be mailed to the winning Maker\u2019s address (if an Eligible Individual) or the Representative\u2019s address (if a Team, Large Organization, or Small Organization) after receipt of the Required Forms. If the winning Maker is an Eligible Individual, the prize check will be made payable to the Eligible Individual. If the winning Maker is a Team, the prize check will be made payable to the Team\u2019s Representative. If the winning Maker is Small Organization, the prize check will be made payable to the Small Organization. It will be the responsibility of the winning Maker\u2019s Representative to allocate the prize among the Team or Small Organization\u2019s participating members, as the Representative deems appropriate. Challenge Entities disclaim any and all responsibility and liability associated with the distribution of the prize proceeds to individual Team or Small Organization members.\nPoster shall make every effort (but does not guarantee) that each prize will be delivered to verified winners within 45 days of the Poster or Administrator\u2019s receipt of the Required Forms and verification of their contents.\nWinners (and in the case of Team or Small Organization, all participating members) are responsible for reporting and paying all applicable taxes in their jurisdiction of residence (federal, state and local). Winners may be required to provide certain information to facilitate receipt of the prize, including completing and submitting any tax or other forms necessary for compliance with applicable withholding and reporting requirements.
