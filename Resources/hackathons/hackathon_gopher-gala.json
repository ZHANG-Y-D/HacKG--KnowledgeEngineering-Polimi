For more information, check out our website: gophergala.com/faq", "hackathon-rules": "\nYou can use other technologies as well (databases, front-end frameworks, etc.), but the core of what you write must be implemented in Go.\nYou can work on the concept of your project before the Gala begins by whiteboarding, conducting user interviews, or hand-drawing interfaces. However, you are not allowed to start writing code (or creating digital designs if your application requires graphic assets) until the competition begins. The one exception is if you've written a publicly available package that you'd like to use in your application. This special case is only allowed if the package does not provide the majority of the functionality for your application, as judged by the Gala organizers. If you're unsure about your situation, please reach out to us in advance.\nJudging will take place in two parts. First, there will be a community-voting stage, where everyone who competed will be able to vote on their favorite applications. Then, we will take the top 20 apps and give them to a group of expert judges to pick the top 5 winners. There will also be a few other prizes, including a crowd-favorite prize and a best solo app prize.\nThey will not be given specific scores for each of these attributes, but rather community and expert judges will be asked to use these criteria when picking their 5 favorite apps.\nYou can participate even if you know a sponsor or one of the judges - we will do our best to make sure no nepotism takes place.\nWe also encourage you to use third-party APIs and other web services. Code will be hosted in a Github repo which we create. We'll send you access information before the Gala begins, and you should push progress regularly throughout the competition.\n", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "Google - Chromebook Pixel per person", "prize-title": "First Prize"}, {"prize-content": "Google - Nexus Player per person", "prize-title": "Second Prize"}, {"prize-content": "Google - Nexus Player per person", "prize-title": "Third Prize"}, {"prize-content": "Google - Chromecast per person", "prize-title": "Fourth Prize"}, {"prize-content": "Google - Chromecast per person", "prize-title": "Fifth Prize"}, {"prize-content": "Rollbar - Raspberry Pi per person", "prize-title": "Crowd Favorite"}, {"prize-content": "Crowd Interactive - trip to Colima, Mexico for a week to hack out of their offices*", "prize-title": "Best Solo App"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=Virtually Racing LLC, 2631 Peachtree Parkway #500, Suwanee, GA 30024, USA", "hackathon-url": "https://gopher-gala.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}], "hackathon-location-address": "Virtually Racing LLC, 2631 Peachtree Parkway #500, Suwanee, GA 30024, USA", "hackathon-description-header": "The world's first Golang distributed hackathon.", "hackathon-prizes-total": "$4,100", "hackathon-location-description": "", "hackathon-end-date": "2015-01-25", "has-projects": "True"}
