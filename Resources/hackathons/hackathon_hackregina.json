{"hackathon-description-text": "\nHackREGINA is our 4th bi-annual hackathon in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. Teams of developers, designers, and analysts compete to make the most interesting, exciting, and usable application using one or more of the sponsoring APIs. At the end of the day, each team presents their project to a 9/28/panel of judges and the other teams, hoping to be awarded with 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place! Join us the evening before the event for our kick-off party, a great place to exchange ideas and network with your peers and the event sponsors. Of course, the day of the event we'll be sure everyone is fed and watered. And after the day is finished we'll wrap up with some catering and a nice drink.", "hackathon-number-of-prizes": "7", "hackathon-id": "hackregina", "hackathon-judges": [{"judge-role": "Business Development Manager, CYBF", "judge-name": "Riley Nadoroznick"}, {"judge-role": "Associate Professor of Entrepreneurship, Hill School of Business, University of Regina", "judge-name": "Dr. Chris Street"}, {"judge-role": "Web Developer, Mobile Designer, GB Internet Solutions", "judge-name": "Eden Rohatensky"}], "hackathon-number-of-judges": "3", "hackathon-eligibility": "", "hackathon-number-of-participants": "30", "hackathon-is-colocated": "True", "hackathon-has-ended": "True", "hackathon-number-of-judging-criteria": "5", "hackathon-requirements": "\nParticipants are expected to create an application that demonstrates their idea, using one or more of the sponsoring APIs. \u00a0We will be announcing all sponsor APIs the week before the event - keep an eye on our website hackregina.com, our twitter account @HackREGINA, and this page for more details.", "hackathon-rules": "", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "1st Place"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "2nd Place"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "3rd Place"}, {"prize-content": "Half or more of your team must be currently enrolled in secondary or post-secondary education", "prize-title": "Student Prize"}, {"prize-content": "As selected by your peers via the gallery like button.
