(We\u2019re willing to work with high school students -- \n). Participation is closed to family of judges.\n\u00a0\nTeams\nTeams must consist of between 1 and 4 participants. Teams must submit a list of members upon submitting their hack by Sunday April 13th, 2014 \u00a0at 10:00 am CDT. Any modifications after that must be approved by organizers. Single person teams are allowed, but we encourage you to work in groups!\n\u00a0\nSubmissions\nEach team is permitted one submission that must be received by 10:00am on Sunday, April 13th, 2014. Code submitted must be produced only by team members and written during HackIllinois from the starting time on Friday, April 11th, 2014 to the submission time. If you are continuing a previous project or using old code written by you, let us know on the project submission form. Third party libraries are allowed without notice provided that they are publicly available to any participant. By submitting a project, you and your team grant the HackIllinois team the unrestricted right to use your submission material, at no cost, for promotional purposes of future HackIllinois events.</legalese>\n\u00a0\nJudging Criteria\nTeams\u2019 demos will be judged on several criteria including usefulness, technical difficulty, polish, and creativity. Teams will not be told their scores during or after judging, and decisions by the judges and HackIllinois team are final.\n\u00a0\nProject Fair\nAt the end of the event, teams will showcase their projects in a project fair. During this time period, judges will proceed to all teams, and a team will have one to two minutes to demo their projects in a project fair. A team\u2019s presentation may be interrupted by a judge at any time. Teams must be ready to demo when the judges reach their table, and passing on a judge relinquishes the right to be judged. Corporate prizes are judged directly by the company, and HackIllinois is not responsible for the criteria used by these companies.\n\u00a0\nWinners\nWinners for general HackIllinois prizes will be selected by a combination of corporate judges and judges provided by HackIllinois. Each winning team will be responsible for working with the University of Illinois Computer Science department to arrange for the payment to be sent. Corporate prizes are judged by the respective company, and are provided directly from a company to the winning team. The winning team is responsible for all taxes associated with a prize.\n\u00a0\nPhotos\nBy attending HackIllinois, you acknowledge that your picture and video may be used without compensation, prior permission, or notification in any promotional material related to HackIllinois.\n\u00a0\nOther Rules\nHave a question, or something we should have included here and didn\u2019t?
