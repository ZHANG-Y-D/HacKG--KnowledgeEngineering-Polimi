In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions\u2019 scores on the next applicable criterion. If two or more Submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Submissions.\n\u00a0\nThe Popular Choice Award, described below in Section 8, will be determined by public voting. Public voting will take place during the Public Voting Period. The Poster and/or Administrator has the right to extend the Public Voting Period at any time for any reason.\nThe Popular Choice Award winner will be the eligible Submission with the highest number of verified votes received on the Submission\u2019s webpage on the Administrator\u2019s website during the Public Voting Period. Verified vote counts will be determined by the Administrator. If there is a tie between two or more Submissions, the winner will be the Submission with the highest score from the Judges based on the Judging Criteria, and if applicable the Tie Breaker procedure, described above in Section 6.\nPublic voting is open to any person with a verified ChallengePost account. Each person is limited to one vote per Submission and may only vote using one account.

Doing so will subject all of your votes to disqualification. The Poster and/or Administrator may also disqualify a Maker, if the Maker receives multiple or irregular votes from the same user or users, receives votes in a manner that indicates manual, automated or other vote manipulation, or attempts to compensate voters.\nIf the voting process fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, the Poster has the right to determine the Popular Choice Award winner by using non-suspect votes, or by any other means they deem appropriate. If no alternative means of determining a winner of the Popular Choice Award is available or selected, the Poster may terminate the Popular Choice Award without designating a winner.\nThe Poster and Administrator are not responsible for, and are not required to count any vote which, in their judgment, is incomplete, late, misdirected, damaged, unlawful or illicit.
