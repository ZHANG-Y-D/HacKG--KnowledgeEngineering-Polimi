The Representative must meet the eligibility requirements above. By entering a Submission on the Site on behalf of a team or organization, you represent and warrant that you are the Representative, and are duly authorized to act on behalf of your team or organization. The Representative shall act on behalf of the team to assume all rights and responsibilities regarding the challenge. If a team entry is selected as a winning entry, GBIF will pay prize money to the Representative, who will bear the responsibility of distributing the prize money to team members.\nMakers must do the following to participate in the Challenge:\nAll Submission materials must be in English or, if not in English, the Maker must provide an English translation of the demonstration video, text description, and testing instructions as well as all other materials submitted.\n: Makers must use GBIF-mediated data in way that produces new representations or insights. Submissions may involve a range of results\u2014websites, stand-alone or mobile applications, or outputs of analyses\u2014or may seek to improve issues or processes including (but not limited to) data analysis or visualization, data workflows, uploading, or annotations.\nThe judges must be able to access the submission at no cost or perform the same analysis/visualization using comparable alternative sources of data.\nIf the submission is a stand-alone application then it must operate on hardware readily available to the judges.\nIf the submission is a mobile app then the submission must enable the judges to access the solution, either by making it publicly available in an app store, by sending the .apk file (Android), or making it available using TestFlight (iOS).\nIf the submission is the output of an analysis then the analysis must be repeatable, with the submission including sufficient detail for repetition.\n: While submissions need not rely exclusively on GBIF as a data source, they must, in the judgement of the Challenge jury and GBIF Secretariat staff, make significant use GBIF-mediated data. Rather than prescribe specific amounts or relative proportions of data, the Challenge organizers expect that qualifying submissions would apply GBIF-mediated data in ways that reasonable observers would consider measurable, meaningful, and important.\n: The submission should be \u201cnovel\u201d in that a significant portion of the submission should be developed for the challenge. A submission based largely (or entirely) on work published or developed prior to the challenge start date will not be eligible for submission.\n: In light of GBIF\u2019s commitment to open-access data\u2014most recently recognized in GBIF\u2019s plans around data licensing\u2014we encourage participants to adopt the most open licences possible for their Challenge submissions. However, each submission will remain the property of its participants, unless otherwise specified. By entering a Submission, the Makers agree to grant GBIF a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use it.\n: A Maker may submit more than one Submission, however, each Submission must be unique and substantially different from the others, as determined by the Administrator.\n: The text description should explain the insights represented in the submission; the GBIF-mediated (and, if any, other) data used; and the process and method used in order to complete the submission, including the tools and algorithms used.\n: The Submission\u2019s visual elements should demonstrate its insights or functionality.\nIf video is included, the video clip:\nRegardless of the format used, these visual elements must be freely accessible to the judges, whether uploaded through an external video hosting service like YouTube or Vimeo or posted as a zip archive to a cloud-based file-sharing service like Dropbox, Box, or OneDrive.\nSubject to the licenses described below, any applicable intellectual property rights to a Submission will remain with the Maker.\nBy entering the Challenge, you grant to the Administrator, and any other third parties acting on the Poster\u2019s behalf, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide perpetual license to display publicly and use for promotional purposes the Submission, in perpetuity. This license includes, but is not limited to, posting or linking to the Submission on Administrator\u2019s, and partners\u2019 websites and applications, including the Challenge Website, and display and promotion of the Submission in any other media, worldwide.\nThe following Submission components may be displayed to the public: name, description, images, video URL, website URL, team members (username only), the Submission category and platform, and submitter type. Other Submission materials may be viewed by the Administrator and Judges for screening and evaluation.\nMakers represent and warrant that the Administrator and Challenge partners are free to use Makers\u2019 Submission in the manner described above, as provided or as modified by Administrator, without obtaining permission or license from any third party and without any compensation to Makers.\nEligible Submissions will be evaluated by a panel of judges selected by the Administrator (the \u201cJudges\u201d), and scored using the following equally weighted criteria (the \u201cJudging Criteria\u201d):\nJudges are not required to test the Application and may choose to judge based solely on the text description and video or screenshots provided in the Submission.\nIf two or more Submissions are tied, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first applicable criterion listed above will be considered the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated, as needed, by comparing the tied Submissions\u2019 scores on the next applicable criterion. If two or more Submissions are tied on all applicable criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Submissions.\nTHE AWARD OF A PRIZE TO A POTENTIAL WINNER IS SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION OF THE IDENTITY, QUALIFICATIONS AND ROLE OF THE POTENTIAL WINNER IN THE CREATION OF THE SUBMISSION.
