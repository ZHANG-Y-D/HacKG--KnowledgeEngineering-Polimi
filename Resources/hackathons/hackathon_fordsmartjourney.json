Doing so will subject all of your votes to disqualification. The Poster and/or Administrator may also disqualify a Maker, if the Maker receives multiple or irregular votes from the same user or users, receives votes in a manner that indicates manual, automated or other vote manipulation, or attempts to compensate voters.\nIf the voting process fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, the Poster has the right to determine the Popular Choice Award winner by using non-suspect votes, or by any other means they deem appropriate. If no alternative means of determining a winner of the Popular Choice Award is available or selected, the Poster may terminate the Popular Choice Award without designating a winner.\nThe Poster and Administrator are not responsible for, and are not required to count any vote which, in their judgment, is incomplete, late, misdirected, damaged, unlawful or illicit.
