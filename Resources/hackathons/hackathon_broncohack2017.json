We want our participants to look at the broader impact of their work. The OMIS Student Network doesn't support the idea that technology has reached the zenith of its use when someone is willing to pay the creator for it. We want our participants to examine the social injustices that are present in our world and to try their hand at reversing them through the power of applied technology.", "hackathon-rules": "\n\nTeams can be anywhere from two to six members. All members must be a builder (a Developer or Designer). If you're looking for fellow teammates please contact the check\u00adin committee upon arrival. Others are looking for teams, too!\n\nTo ensure a level field for all contestants, all code, design, art, music, SFX, and assets must be created during the duration of the Hackathon. We want to ensure that all participants start off on the same footing and we also want to preserve the true nature of a hackathon. You are, however, free to make plans, create wireframes, and brainstorm prior to the event. The only exception to this rule would include material that is freely available to the public. Some examples of this would be: public domain images, creative commons music, open source libraries. We take this rule very seriously for the sake of all members attending the event. Failure to comply may result in the offending team's disqualification. All teams will be subject to a code review to verify that there was no foul play.\n\nThe exception to the above rule is that you are encouraged to use 3rd party services, APIs, open source projects, libraries, and frameworks. Let's face it, we need all the help we can get during the hectic event. There's no need to break DRY rules when there are so many great resources available to all Hackers. Many of our past contestants have taken advantage of the various offerings from our event partners to great effect.\n\nAll teams retain full ownership of what they have created during the Hackathon. BroncoHack is here to help entrepreneurs realize their dreams, not destroy them.\n\nThere will be no alcohol served or allowed at the event.\n\nBe kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and racist, sexist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for this event.\n\n\n\u2022 If you have sufficient time, take personal belongings. Otherwise, leave them. If a chaperon notes to leave them, leave them! Do not spend time collecting items.\n\u2022 Assist others who need help.\n\u2022 Use nearest stairs and safe exit. DO NOT USE ELEVATOR. (Important for those on 2 nd and 3 rd floor)\u00a0\n\u2022 Proceed to the Emergency Assembly Point. The Emergency Assembly Point location is QQ indicated on the Evacuation Maps posted throughout the building. The assembly point for Lucas is located in the parking lot at the far north east corner. Do not leave the area without checking in at the Emergency Assembly Point first.\n\u2022 Wait for instructions from emergency responders and do not re\u00adenter the building until an all\u00adclear is given.\n**Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the Hackathon at the sole discretion of the Hackathon organizers.
