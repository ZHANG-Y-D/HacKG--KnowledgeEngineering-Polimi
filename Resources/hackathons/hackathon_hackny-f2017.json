We value the participation of each member of the student community\u00a0and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the hackathon. To make clear what is expected, all attendees and speakers at this hackathon are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.\nWe believe that every single person has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment. All hackNY Participants agree to:\nWe are also adopting social rules based on the Recurse Center\u2019s User Manual. These are guidelines for making expected behavior more well-defined. Few people are unkind or annoying to others on purpose, so these social rules help us all to avoid behaviors harmful to a supportive, productive, and fun learning environment.\nIf someone violates these social rules, feel free to point it out to that person, or report it to our volunteers or organizers. If you are the one responsible for breaking a social rule, apologize and move forward. Multiple violations of these rules may result in a warning, and extremely sustained, repeated, or willful violations may result in expulsion from the hackathon.\nIf you feel uncomfortable or think there may be a potential violation of the code of conduct, please report it immediately using one of the following methods. All reporters have the right to remain anonymous. By sending information to the general reporting line, your report will go to any or all of the five Major League Hacking representatives listed below, and be relayed to the hackNY Fall 2017 Hackathon Organizers.
