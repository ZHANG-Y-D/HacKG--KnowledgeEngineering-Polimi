The Judges will evaluate each Submission on the criteria identified below to select five (5) Finalist Award Winners. The Sponsor and the Administrator reserve the right to substitute or modify the judging panel at any time for any reason.\nB. All Judges shall be and remain fair and impartial.

The Popular Choice Finalist Award winner is not eligible to be a Finalist Award winner. If the Popular Choice Finalist Award winner is one of the five Contestants whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores from the Judges, then the Contestant whose Submission earns the sixth overall highest score, will become a potential winner of the Finalist Award.\nE. Tie Breakers. In the event of a tie between two or more Submissions, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first criterion listed above shall be deemed the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated by comparing the tied Submissions\u2019 scores on the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth criterion listed above, respectively. If two or more Submissions are tied on all six criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied submissions (the \u201cTie-Breaker Criteria\u201d).\nF. A Contestant\u2019s likelihood of becoming a Finalist Award Winner will depend primarily on the number and quality of Submissions, as determined by the Judges using the criteria in these Official Rules.\u00a0\nA. Voting on the Competition Website during the Public Voting Period will determine the potential winner of the Popular Choice Finalist Award.\nB. The potential winner of the Popular Choice Finalist Award will be determined on the basis of the verified vote counts, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion. The Sponsor and the Administrator reserve the right to extend or change the Public Voting Period at any time for any reason.\nC. One (1) potential winner of the Popular Choice Finalist Award (described in Section 13 below) will be selected based solely on the highest number of verified votes received from Registered Visitors on the Competition Website.\u00a0 If there is a tie between or among two or more Submissions for the Popular Choice Award, the higher scoring Submission will be determined by the Tie-Breaker Criteria (described in Section 9 E above).\u00a0\nD. The likelihood of being selected to win the Popular Choice Finalist Award depends on the total number of verified votes received on the Submissions relative to other Submissions.\u00a0\nE. Use of an automated process or similar device to submit an electronic vote is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to circumvent the one-vote limit per Submission, including the use of multiple email addresses or any form of automated vote processes will subject all votes from the person or entity to disqualification. The Sponsor and/or the Administrator reserves the right to disqualify any Contestant at their sole discretion, if a Contestant receives multiple and/or irregular votes from the same user or users, or receives votes in a manner that otherwise may indicate automated or non-automated vote manipulation. If the voting process for the Popular Choice Finalist Award fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, the Sponsor and/or the Administrator at their sole discretion reserve the right to determine the Popular Choice Finalist Award by using non-suspect votes, or by any other means the Administrator deems appropriate.\u00a0 Contestants may not pay or otherwise compensate anyone or provide any other type of consideration in exchange for votes. If no alternative means of determining a winner of the Popular Choice Finalist Award is available, Administrator may eliminate the Popular Choice Finalist Award or award one addition Finalist Award.\u00a0\u00a0\nA. Following the Studio Phase, the Judges will evaluate the Finalist Award winners and Popular Choice Finalist Award winner during the Grand Prize Judging Period.\nB. Finalists will attend a judging event where they will give a presentation on their progress developing and commercializing their Product and provide Judges with access to a physical prototype of their Product, if possible. Sponsor shall have the sole ability to determine the date and the location of the presentation. Failure to give a presentation may result in immediate disqualification.\u00a0\nC. Judges will rate all six Finalists using the following two (2) equally weighted criteria:\n(i) \n (Including the relative progress made developing a prototype and bringing the Product to market, and the team\u2019s success in executing on their goals); and\n(ii) \n (Including commercial potential of the Product and the team\u2019s potential for success after the Studio Phase).\nD. The one (1) Finalist whose Submission earns the highest overall score will become the potential winner of the Grand Prize \u2013 Most Promising Business Award prize identified below in Section 13.\u00a0\nE. Tie Breakers.\u00a0 In the event of a tie between or among two or more Finalists, the tied Finalist with the highest score in the first criterion listed above shall be deemed the higher scoring Finalist. In the event any ties remain, the tied Finalist with the highest score in the second criterion listed above shall be deemed the higher scoring Finalist. If two or more Finalists are tied on both criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied Finalists.\nF. A Contestant\u2019s likelihood of winning the Grand Prize \u2013 Most Promising Business Award once selected as a Finalist, will depend primarily on the Contestant\u2019s progress during the Studio Phase, their potential to develop a successful business, and the progress and potential of other Finalists, as determined by the Judges using the criteria listed above in 11 C (i) and (ii).\u00a0\nA.
