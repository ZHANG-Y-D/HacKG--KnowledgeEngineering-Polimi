This is hackathon is meant to bring people together to create solutions for girls and women. We want you to work \n with each other, be \n, and have the \n time doing it. You should be learning new things and making friends throughout the weekend! \u00a0\nAs for code of conduct, we expect everyone to to adhere to this: https://hackcodeofconduct.org/\n\nBuild and demonstrate your idea through a functioning prototype. Your projects are \nrequired to be technical; however, development is part of the judging criteria.\n\nAny code for the project must be entirely coded at the hackathon (you get over 24 hours to hack!). However, we do encourage use of publicly available frameworks/APIs and open-source code.\n\nAny finalists will have their code audited by a developer appointed by Girls in Tech. Your code is yours, but we would like to see it if you are a finalist.\n\nUse Git or an equivalent to track your code as you write it. If it comes down to an audit, it\u2019ll help you prove your code is new.\n\nReally push yourself to create something that is a viable solution to help girls and women - the possibilities are endless! You could do anything from helping women keep track of their menstrual cycle to creating an app to tackle sex trafficking.\n\nYou must pitch your product as what you\u2019ve submitted to us! If you deviate from your submission, your pitch will not be considered during the judging process.\n\nEach team will be limited to a size of 3-5 members. Every hacker is limited to working with one team to submit one project. We want to to see your best work and to dedicate your time on a single project.\n\u00a0", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "Each team member receives a Galaxy Tablet (up to 5)", "prize-title": "Hacking for Humanity SF - 1st Place"}, {"prize-content": "5 Amazon Echos ($250)", "prize-title": "Hacking for Humanity SF - 2nd Place"}, {"prize-content": "5 Fitbits", "prize-title": "Hacking for Humanity SF - 3rd Place"}, {"prize-content": "Girls in Tech Tshirts", "prize-title": "GIT Favorite"}, {"prize-content": "Philz Gift Box ($100)", "prize-title": "Honorable Mention"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=221 Main St #1000, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA", "hackathon-url": "https://girls-in-tech-sf-h4h.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}], "hackathon-location-address": "221 Main St #1000, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA", "hackathon-description-header": "Women Uniting to Solve Global Challenges", "hackathon-prizes-total": "$3,240", "hackathon-location-description": "DocuSign", "hackathon-end-date": "2017-07-09", "has-projects": "True"}
