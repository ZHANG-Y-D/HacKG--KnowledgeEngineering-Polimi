{"hackathon-description-text": "\nThis Spring, VR Club at UCSD is partnering with the Center for Cyber-Archaeology & Sustainability at UCSD to host a VR Cyber-Archaeology hackathon. Participants will have 36 hours to create a Virtual Reality experience with applications for at-risk archaeological sites from the eastern Mediterranean region. All attendees will be provided with a wealth of archaeological data including point cloud scans, photos, and 3D models of cultural heritage sites and artifacts, as well as VR equipment for their hacks.", "hackathon-number-of-prizes": "4", "hackathon-id": "vrarchaeology", "hackathon-judges": [{"judge-role": "Director, Center for Cyber-Archaeology and Sustainability", "judge-name": "Thomas E.
