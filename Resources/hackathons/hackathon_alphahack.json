Examples would be something that measures (or even predicts) macro indicators like inflation, gdp, unemployment and manufacturing.\n2) Parse sentiment in financial news/social media text and/or video and image content on the web using Bluemix to create a sentiment based indicator that can measure and/or predict market direction.\n3) Analyze huge volumes of sec.gov data to perform real time fundamental analysis on companies using public filings using Watson. Insight should be useful in identifying undervalued stocks or short sale candidates. An offshoot project may involve scanning regulatory filings in real time and cross referencing options markets to create an indicator that could flag potential insider trading activity.\n4) Use Bluemix to create a polling tool that can be used to gather consensus opinion from alpha modus users about various topics like stock market direction, a stock's price or even a political election, a sporting event or new product release. Apply creativity in determining topics to poll. Then create an interactive real time visualization to display results of the poll.\nSuggested Bluemix APIs to Use:\nWrite your app in Node.js, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Go or bring your own runtime. For live interactive session click here\nUse a boilerplate for Mobile, Watson, Internet of Things (IoT), Node.js, Java or more.
