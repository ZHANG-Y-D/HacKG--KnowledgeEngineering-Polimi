{"hackathon-description-text": "\nPreceding the Disrupt Conference is Hackathon weekend on December 5-6, where \u00a0developers and engineers descend from all over the world to take part in a 24-hour hacking endurance test. Teams join forces to build a new product, present it on the Disrupt stage to a panel of expert judges and an audience of tens of thousands and compete for a variety of prizes, including the chance to win free tickets to the Disrupt Conference. Products created at the Disrupt Hackathon have seen great success beyond the event, like GroupMe which was created overnight and ultimately acquired by Skype for $80M.", "hackathon-number-of-prizes": "11", "hackathon-id": "disrupteu2015", "hackathon-judges": [{"judge-role": "", "judge-name": "Natalie Campbell"}, {"judge-role": "", "judge-name": "Asa Calow"}, {"judge-role": "", "judge-name": "Raph Crouan"}, {"judge-role": "", "judge-name": "Marily Nika"}, {"judge-role": "", "judge-name": "Taylor Wescoatt"}], "hackathon-number-of-judges": "5", "hackathon-eligibility": "\nMake you have an Evenbrite ticket for the hackathon.

This is a very diverse environment, made up of many races, religions, sexual orientations, genders, and gender identities. Any behavior or presentation that objectifies or belittles others will be halted, with the presenters immediately disqualified and removed from the event. Don\u2019t behave in a way or present anything you wouldn\u2019t be proud to have your parents see. For more information surrounding our policies on harassment, please\u00a0\n.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a Powerpoint-athon! Build and demonstrate a working project, don\u2019t just show us screenshots and slides.\n\nThe project you present must be coded entirely during the Hackathon. The only exceptions are for publicly available frameworks/APIs and open-source code that has been available for at least a month. If it feels shady to use the code, don\u2019t.\n\nFinalists will have their code audited to make sure it\u2019s all new and legit, by a developer appointed by TechCrunch. Your code belongs to you and we won\u2019t share it with anyone, but we will want to see it if you win.\n\nUse Git or an equivalent to track your code as you write it. It\u2019s good practice, and if it comes down to an audit, it\u2019ll help you prove your code is new.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an opportunity to promote your team\u2019s pre-existing product. Don\u2019t tack one tiny feature onto your existing product and call it a day.\n\nYou must present your hack as described in your submission \u2013 if you deviate from your accepted submission, we\u2019ll have to boot you from the stage. Don\u2019t submit one thing and then abuse the stage and respect of the audience to present something different.\n\nWe\u2019re limiting the number of members per team at 5, in the interest of keeping things fair. All other things equal, it\u2019s not very reasonable for a team of 2 or 3 to compete against a team of 20.\nAlso, we strongly suggest that each hacker gives their attention to just one team, rather than trying to be a part of multiple projects; we want to see your best work, and it\u2019s hard to do your best work when you\u2019re jumping from table to table.", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Grand Prize"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Hack Disrupt 2nd Place"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Hack Disrupt 3rd Place"}, {"prize-content": "Best use of Esri ArcGIS mapping technology wins $5,000 prize ($2,500 cash, plus $2,500 ArcGIS Online subscription).", "prize-title": "ESRI"}, {"prize-content": "The winning team will receive William Hill\u2019s Ultimate Sporting World Tour.
