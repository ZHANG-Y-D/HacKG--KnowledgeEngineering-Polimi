Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed.\n. Consider and respect other people's opinions and beliefs. Everyone is entitled to their point of view and a diverse range of opinions and perspectives is one thing that allows us to create such innovative solutions at a rapid pace.\n. We welcome attendees from all backgrounds and a hackathon is a great opportunity for learning and meeting new people. Be friendly, welcome and open with your fellow participants. Share your knowledge, expertise and opinions, and embrace those of other people. Consider open source licensing and use of open data and how code you are writing could be reused.\n. Do your best and believe in yourself. A hackathon is an incredible experience for people of any ability level; everyone can make a valuable contribution. Not every project will be successful, but ideas that you believe in are worth trying. You could change the world, and if every one project that we build helps someone, saves a life or makes a positive difference, we have succeeded.\n\nThe MIDAS Public Health\u00a0Hackathon (referred to as \"Hackathon\") is promoted and hosted by\u00a0the MIDAS MISSION 2.0 Group\u00a0and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, which shall here on be referred to as the \u201corganizers\u201d.
