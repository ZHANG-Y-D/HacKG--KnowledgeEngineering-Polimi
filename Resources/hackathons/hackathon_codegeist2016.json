The Contestants assume the responsibility for identifying each member of a team at the time the team submits its Entry, and Atlassian does not assume any responsibility for checking the identification of team members. The members of a team that are identified with the submission of an Entry shall be final and that team may not add, remove or substitute members, or otherwise change the composition of the team, for the duration of the Competition. Furthermore, a Contestant that is part of a team understands and agrees that if his or her team is selected to receive a prize, each Contestant on the team is responsible for ensuring the prize is appropriately distributed to each member of the team. Finally, in order to remain eligible to win a prize, the team and each member of that team must satisfy the eligibility requirements in these rules, including the submission of a Contest Prize Validation Agreement (discussed below); if one member of the team does not comply with these Rules or is disqualified, the team as a whole will be disqualified.\n5.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Atlassian encourages entries from businesses and other legal entities. If an Entry is submitted on behalf of a corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other legal entity (any of which being referred to as a \"Business Entity\"), the Contestant(s) submitting the Entry hereby certifies to Atlassian that (1) the appropriate authorization from the corporate officers, executives, managers or other required persons or group has been obtained, (2) the individual Contestants are in some manner legally associated with the Business Entity, and (3) the individual accepting the Rules on behalf of the Business Entity is authorized to legally bind the Business Entity. A Business Entity submitting an Entry shall be legally bound by these Rules by the act of the Contestant(s) acting on its behalf. Each Contestant associated with or submitting an Entry for or on behalf of a Business Entity acknowledges and agrees that if the Contestant enters the Competition without obtaining the requisite authorization, Atlassian may, in its sole discretion, disqualify the Contestant and the Business Entity and any submitted Entry. Finally, if a Business Entity is selected to receive a prize, a corporate officer or other authorized person entitled to bind the Business Entity will be required to execute and deliver the Contest Prize Validation Agreement on behalf of the Business Entity.\n6.

Instead, the decision on how to distribute or divide any prize among individual team members or within Business Entities is the sole responsibility of the participating team or Business Entity. Each Contestant hereby expressly waives any claim they may have against Atlassian relating to the division of any prize among team members or Business Entities and expressly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Atlassian from and against any and all claims relating to such allocation of prizes and agrees that Atlassian may offset against the amount of any prize to be awarded the amount of costs incurred by Atlassian, including any legal or other professional fees, arising from or relating to any such claim or dispute.\n9.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The payment to potential prize recipients is subject to the express requirement that the Contestant submit to Atlassian (or Devpost on behalf of Atlassian) all documentation requested by Atlassian (or Devpost on behalf of Atlassian) to permit it to comply with all applicable tax reporting and withholding requirements.

The winning Contestant(s) shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with all the applicable tax laws and filing requirements and the payment of all taxes that may be assessed against the Contestant on account of their receipt of a prize. If a Contestant fails to comply with the requirements of these Rules, the right to receive the prize may be forfeited, and Atlassian may, in its sole discretion, select an alternative prize recipient.\n9.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Actual odds of winning depend on the number of eligible entries received.
