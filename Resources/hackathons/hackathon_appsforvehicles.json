This vehicle data has long been available to mechanics and technicians using specialized equipment.\u00a0 But by applying open data principles, individuals will be able to readily access this on-board data directly through Bluetooth, USB, and other standard hardware. Associated platforms will enable vehicle owners to provide this data to authorized third-party developers to create and then deliver new apps, products, and services.\u00a0 As a result, these third-party developers will help Americans while also creating jobs.\nUnder Federal initiatives like the \u201c\n\u201d Grand Challenge and new fuel economy standards, the DOE\u2019s Vehicles Technology program has a long-term role to play in the acceleration of automotive technology.\u00a0 Looking to a near-term project that can support this vision, a prize-based Challenge is an effective method to spur innovation with step-jump additions in the availability of new open data.\nThis Challenge prize is a three-part combination of: (1) a cash award; (2) an opportunity to work directly with industry leaders; and (3) an opportunity to be recognized at a public announcement of the final winners.\u00a0 The Challenge prize will be awarded in phases and component pieces in two phases of competition.\u00a0 Phase I of the Challenge will cast a wide net to gather compelling ideas, business plans, product development plans, and very-early-stage products (\u201cIdeations\u201d) that address the Challenge\u2019s goals.\u00a0 Phase I concludes with a selection of Finalists that will be permitted to continue into Phase II and each Finalist will be awarded a small portion of the total cash pool, ranging from $1000 to $5000.\u00a0 During Phase II, Finalists will have an opportunity to refine their Ideations with industry leaders supporting the Challenge.\u00a0 These industry leaders will provide some combination of: technical guidance, customer analysis, market assessments, IT roadmap recommendations, and general consulting.\u00a0 Following consultation with industry leaders, Finalists will have a period of time to complete and submit their final software applications, web technology, or products (\u201cProducts\u201d) for Phase II.\u00a0 Phase II winner(s) will be invited to a public announcement event hosted by DOE and its supporters and will also be highlighted on DOE\u2019s web site.\u00a0 For the purposes of this Challenge, the term Submissions (\u201cSubmissions\u201d) refers to the total portfolio of Phase I Ideations and Phase II Products.\u00a0 The total cash prize pool, inclusive of all cash awards available to be made in Phases I and II, is $50,000.\nThis Challenge is being conducted under the authority of the America COMPETES Act of 2010, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 3719.\u00a0 The total dollar amount of the prize pool is $50,000.00, subject to the availability of funds.\u00a0 DOE reserves the right to suspend, cancel, extend, or curtail the Challenge as required or determined by appropriate DOE officials. Nothing within this document or in any documents supporting the Challenge shall be construed as obligating DOE or any other Federal agency or instrumentality to any expenditure of appropriated funds, or any obligation or expenditure of funds in excess of or in advance of available appropriations.\u00a0 DOE will award a single dollar amount to winning Team(s) and each Team is solely responsible for allocating any prize amount among its member Contestants as they deem appropriate.\u00a0 DOE will not arbitrate, intervene, advise on, or resolve any matters between entrant members.\u00a0\u00a0 It will be up to the winning Team to reallocate the prize money among its member Contestants, if they deem it appropriate.\u00a0\nTo be eligible to compete within this Challenge all of the requirements stated below must be met:\nThere are many electrical and digital systems operating within vehicles.\u00a0 For this Challenge, the data resources that are to be used by entrants are the datasets that can be directly and legally accessed by vehicle owners on their own cars.\u00a0 The principal example of this data stream is available through the onboard diagnostics port, also known as OBD-II, which has been mandatory for U.S. cars since 1996.\u00a0 The OBD-II port contains hundreds of data messages regarding engine and transmission operation as communicated through the vehicle\u2019s controller area network, which is referred to as the CAN.\u00a0 The OBD-II port also frequently contains information on operator-adjustable items such as headlight or windshield wiper status. \u00a0\u00a0Additional hardware is commercially available for individuals to directly access their own vehicles\u2019 OBD-II data.\u00a0 However, to remove the need to acquire special hardware for this Challenge and to level the playing field, sample data will be provided by DOE and supporters of the Challenge (\u201cSample Vehicle Data\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Sample Vehicle Data will contain the following representative types of data fields:\nThe above list of example data streams is not comprehensive and is subject to change. \u00a0Multiple sets of data detailing different driving cycles may be made available.\nThere are additional manufacturer proprietary data fields that also stream through the OBD-II port.\u00a0 Such proprietary and confidential data \u2013 such as those that deal with air bags \u2013 shall not be provided or considered at any point in the Challenge.\u00a0\nUse of open vehicle data is mandatory to be considered for a prize in this Challenge.\u00a0 However, combining the value of this data with other \n \u2013 such as mashing up/combining the OBD-II with GPS technologies on a smart phone \u2013 \n.\n\nThe protection of safety and privacy are paramount to both DOE\u2019s Energy Data Initiative and this Challenge.\u00a0 Any business plan or product that presents a clear or potential violation of this principle will be rejected by the judges.\u00a0 Each of the four criteria categories below has equal importance in the evaluation (i.e. 25% weighting for each).\nCommon Criteria for Both Phases\n: Each Submission will be rated on the strength of its potential to help individuals, organizations, and communities make informed decisions to improve their fuel efficiency.\n: Each Submission will be rated for the degree of new thinking it brings to applications for the transportation sector, and the creativity shown in designing for impact.\n: Each Submission must make use of open vehicle data. \u00a0Judges will be looking at both the depth of usage for each data stream and the breadth of different data streams that are integrated.\u00a0 The combination of the Sample Vehicle Data with other data sets \u2013 such as those that are universally generated by smart phones \u2013 is highly encouraged.\u00a0 You can find other sample datasets at \n.\nSpecial Criteria for Phase I Ideations\n: Each Submission will be rated on the completeness of the Ideation and the evidence \u2013 such as can be demonstrated by documented/demonstrated experience \u2013 that the Team\u2019s proposal can actually be created in the remaining time period of the Challenge.\nSpecial Criteria for Phase II Products\n: Each Submission will be rated on its ability to be immediately used by consumers, such as a vehicle owner being able to download an app onto their smartphone from a website or mobile app platform.\u00a0 User experience and interactive capabilities will also be assessed. \u00a0Preference will be given to applications/products that are accessible to a range of consumers, including those with disabilities.\u00a0 Phase II needs to result in real products that can be used; not just illustrations or demonstrations.\nSubmissions will be judged by an expert panel as well as the public.\u00a0 The expert judging panel will be appointed by DOE, may include both Federal and non-Federal personnel, and will determine Phase I and Phase II winners.\u00a0 The Popular Choice Product will be determined by public vote on Challenge.gov.\u00a0 Public votes may be displayed on the Challenge website, on a real-time basis, before being verified for integrity. These unverified votes will not necessarily reflect accurately the voting for the Popular Choice Awards.\u00a0 The winners of the Popular Choice Awards will be determined on the basis of the verified vote counts, as determined by DOE, and DOE reserves the right to suspend, cancel or extend the Popular Choice Product voting period at any time for any reason.\nThe Administrator\u2019s computer, within the DOE\u2019s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, is the official time-keeping device for this Challenge.\u00a0 The rules for Submissions \u2013 defined above as referring to both the Phase I Ideations and Phase II Products \u2013 by Teams are as follows:\n(a) Visit http://AppsforVehicles.challenge.gov and click \u201cSign Up\u201d to create a ChallengePost account, or click \u201cLog In\u201d and log in with an existing ChallengePost account.\n(b) Register your interest in participating by clicking \u201cAccept this Challenge\u201d on the Challenge Website in order to receive important Challenge updates.
