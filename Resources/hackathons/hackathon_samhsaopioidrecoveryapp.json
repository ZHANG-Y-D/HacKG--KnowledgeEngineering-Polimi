All eligible Submissions will be judged by an expert panel of impartial judges (the \u201cJudges\u201d) selected by the Sponsor.

If deemed necessary by the judging panel, each of the top five finalists may be asked to participate in a virtual or in-person meeting with federal staff to discuss their Application and demonstrate its operation. The purpose of these meetings will be to further evaluate the Contestant's product, provide any additional information to SAMHSA, and clarify any concerns or questions raised by the review panel.\nF. Tie Breakers. In the event of a tie between two or more Submissions, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied submissions.\u00a0\nG.
