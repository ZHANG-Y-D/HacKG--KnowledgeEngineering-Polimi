Further rules changes may occur throughout the weekend in response to questions and emerging issues. Such changes will be announced if and when they occur. The following rules have been set at this time: Teams may have a maximum size of 8 members, excluding mentors and roving participants that assist multiple teams such as voice actors, composers, and other specialists. Teams may use content from third-party sources such as the asset store provided that the judges are provided with all details of this use during judging. Teams may use content from their own prior existing projects provided that they clear this use with the event organizers. This is to ensure that all teams have access to a similar pool of resources. Teams must register using the forms provided on Saturday evening in order to be eligible for prizes. Projects must be produced on-site at the hackathon. The organizers will make exceptions to this rule for teams that require other environments, for example, for filming a 360 scene outdoors. Announcements will be made using the event's Slack channel. Though attempts will be made to inform teams of any announcements in person, this is not guaranteed. It is the responsibility of each team to monitor the Slack channel for any important information. In a change from previous events, we will allocate work spaces to teams on Friday night. Teams will no longer be able to claim spaces in a free-for-all as they have previously. We will be looking into pipe & drape dividers to help divide the main room and prevent interference between equipment. Code of Conduct We, the AR/VR Hackathon Latvia Organizers, are committed to making the VR Hackathon a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or technical expertise (or lack of any of the aforementioned). We will not tolerate harassment of any kind. Harassment may include verbal abuse, sexually explicit or derogatory language, offensive or sexual cartoons or materials, mimicry, offensive gestures, unwelcome sexual advances, and telling of jokes offensive to others in the community. In general, sexual advances of any kind are considered unwelcome by default and are not appropriate at this event. Drugs and alcohol are not permitted on site. Individuals who appear intoxicated or otherwise under the influence of drugs or alcohol will be asked to leave the event until they have recovered. If, in the eyes of the Organizers, a hackathon participant is seen to have violated these rules, they may be warned, sanctioned, or asked to leave the hackathon without a refund (if applicable). In other words, just do the following: be aware of your actions and their effects on others; don\u2019t treat the hackathon like a dating sim; and, in general, be nice to one another.\n\u00a0", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Special prize from Accenture"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=3 T\u0113rbatas iela, Valmiera, Latvia", "hackathon-url": "https://arvrhackathonlv.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": ""}], "hackathon-location-address": "3 T\u0113rbatas iela, Valmiera, Latvia", "hackathon-description-header": "AR Hackathon with Trond Nilsen is event for people interested in augmented and virtual reality technology, who wishes to experiment and execute their idea using these technologies.", "hackathon-prizes-total": "$500", "hackathon-location-description": "Vidzeme University of Applied Sciences - Riga, Latvia", "hackathon-end-date": "", "has-projects": "False"}
