Some people go to compete but most people take part to better themselves and have fun. Whatever the reason is you're at a hackathon, make sure you're upholding the\u00a0\n\u00a0by collaborating with other teams, helping beginners, and having fun.\n\u00a0\nAfter hacking finishes, teams will show their projects each other and to the judges.\nYou are strongly encouraged to present a demo of what you have built. Pitches or presentations are discouraged. You are not judged on the quality of your pitch or the quality of your idea. As you are judged on what you built, you'll only hurt yourself by not showing a demo.\nYou are encouraged to present what you have done even if your hack is broken or you weren\u2019t able to finish. It's okay if you didn't finish your hack\u2014that happens all the time! Completion is only one part of the judging criteria, so you might still do well. Also, demoing is not just about the competition. It's a chance to share with others what you learned and what you tried to build\u2014that's what hacking's all about! For being courageous enough to demo, you'll receive a special MLH \"I Demoed\" sticker\u2014it doesn't matter how good the demo is! In the case that you don't have anything to demo, you can give a presentation about what you tried and what you learned. Hearing what other people learned is interesting and inspiring for other attendees.\nTeams will be judged on these four criteria. Judges will weigh the criteria equally. During judging, participants should try to describe what they did for each criterion in their project.\nThese criteria will guide judges but ultimately judges are free to make decisions based on their gut feeling of which projects are the most impressive and most deserving.\nIt's important to note that these judging criteria do not include:\nSo don't worry about coming up with the next big idea or building the next Facebook. You'll have plenty of time for that outside the hackathon. just focus on learning, having fun, and making new friends. At the end of the day the skills you learn and the friends you make might lead to the next big thing\u2014but you don't have to do that to win a hackathon.\nRemember!\nThe competition is just a part of the hackathon. To make the most out of the event, try something new, teach other people, and make new friends!\nHappy Hacking!", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "1 per member of the prize-winning team, limit 4.", "prize-title": "4x ASUS 556UA Notebook"}, {"prize-content": "1 per member of the prize-winning team, limit 4.", "prize-title": "4x Monoprice Select Mini 3D Printer"}, {"prize-content": "1 per member of the prize-winning team, limit 4.", "prize-title": "4x Jetbrains Single Tool/IDE Professional Licenses"}, {"prize-content": "1 per member of the prize-winning team, limit 4.", "prize-title": "IoT track: 4x CanaKit Raspberry Pi 3 Ultimate Starter Kit - 32 GB Edition"}, {"prize-content": "1 per member of the prize-winning team, limit 4.", "prize-title": "VR Track: 4x Google Daydream Headset + Case"}, {"prize-content": "Best Use of Oracle Cloud!", "prize-title": "Oracle Track: 5x Oracle Medallion + Oracle Backpack + Oracle Headphones"}, {"prize-content": "1 per member of the prize-winning team, limit 4", "prize-title": "PROS Track: 4x Drone"}, {"prize-content": "1 per member of the prize-winning team, limit 4", "prize-title": "BlueChasm Challenge #1: Timbuk2 Parkside Laptop Backpack"}, {"prize-content": "1 per member of the prize-winning team, limit 4", "prize-title": "BlueChasm Challenge #2: Code&amp;Quill Monolith notebook and Rotring mechanical Pencil"}, {"prize-content": "1 per member of the prize-winning team, limit 4", "prize-title": "Citadel Casing Solutions Track: Amazon Echo"}, {"prize-content": "Raspberry Pi & PiHut Essential Kit", "prize-title": "Best Domain Name from Domain.com"}, {"prize-content": "$250 Amazon Web Services Credit", "prize-title": "Amazon Web Services - Best Use of AWS"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=4742 Calhoun Rd, Houston, TX 77004, USA", "hackathon-url": "https://codered-exploration.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": "Was the project like nothing you have seen before?
