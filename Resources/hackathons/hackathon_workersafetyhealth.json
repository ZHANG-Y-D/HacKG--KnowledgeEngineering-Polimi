{"hackathon-description-text": "\nRoughly 18 million workers in the United States are 24 years old or younger and constitute almost 15% of the workforce. In 2009, 359 workers between the ages of 13 and 24 died from work-related injuries. In addition, there were over 800,000 non-fatal work-related injuries that required medical attention. The rate of emergency room treated occupational injuries is double for workers under the age of 25 in comparison to those 25 years and older. Workers, especially young workers, need to be aware of hazards they may face on their job and what they can do to protect themselves. Young workers are often unaware of their rights to raise workplace safety concerns.", "hackathon-number-of-prizes": "4", "hackathon-id": "workersafetyhealth", "hackathon-judges": [{"judge-role": "", "judge-name": "Full List of Judges"}], "hackathon-number-of-judges": "1", "hackathon-eligibility": "", "hackathon-number-of-participants": "669", "hackathon-is-colocated": "False", "hackathon-has-ended": "True", "hackathon-number-of-judging-criteria": "3", "hackathon-requirements": "", "hackathon-rules": "", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "Grand Prize"}, {"prize-content": "The winner of this award will be determined by the application that best features information for young workers that showcases how decisions affecting safety and health in the workplace can have serious consequences.", "prize-title": "Safety and Health Data Award"}, {"prize-content": "The winner of this award will be determined by the application that best educates workers about their rights in the workplace.", "prize-title": "Workers\u2019 Rights Award"}, {"prize-content": "The entry with the greatest public approval will receive $3,000.", "prize-title": "People's Choice Award"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "", "hackathon-url": "https://workersafetyhealth.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": "How well does the application address the goals defined for this challenge?
