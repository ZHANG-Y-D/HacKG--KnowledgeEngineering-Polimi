Public display of a Submission on the Competition Website gallery does not constitute a final determination by the Sponsor and/or Administrator that the Submission met requirements and is eligible.\u00a0 Accordingly a Submission may still be disqualified even after it has been publically displayed.\u00a0\u00a0\nC. Non-Contestants interested in the Competition may obtain updates on the Competition by creating an account on the Competition Website or by logging in using an existing ChallengePost account. Additionally, such registered visitors (\u201cRegistered Visitors\u201d) will be able to cast one vote during the Public Voting Period (as further defined in Section 2 above) for each of their favorite Submissions as part of the Popular Choice Finalist (as further defined in Section 10(c) below) selection, as further described in Section 10 below.\u00a0\nA. During the Finalist Judging Period, the Submissions will be evaluated by a qualified panel of impartial judges (the \u201cJudges\u201d) selected by the Sponsor and the Administrator. Such Submissions may be evaluated in one or more rounds of judging, and each round of judging may involve different Judges. The Judges will evaluate each Submission on the criteria identified below to select nine (9) finalists (the \u201cFinalists\u201d). The Sponsor and the Administrator reserve the right to substitute or modify the judging panel at any time for any reason.\u00a0\nB. All Judges shall be and remain fair and impartial. Any Judge may recuse him or herself from judging a Submission if the Judge, the Sponsor or the Administrator considers that it is inappropriate, for any reason, for the Judge to evaluate a specific Submission or group of Submissions. This includes, but is not limited to, cases where a Judge has a material business relationship or affiliation with a Contestant.\u00a0\nC. Judges will rate the quality of all Submissions using the following six (6) equally weighted criteria:\u00a0\n(i) \n (including creativity and originality);\u00a0\n(ii) \n (including design, visual aesthetic, and ease of use);\n(iii) \n (including the potential impact on an urgent healthcare need);\u00a0\n(iv) \n (including feasibility of distribution to target users, scalability, and potential demand);\u00a0\n(v) \n (including prior successes and experience of team members and capacity of the team to execute and bring the technology to market);\u00a0and\n(vi)\u00a0\n-\u00a0Includes the potential impact on the creation of NYC-based healthcare technology jobs.\nD. The nine (9) Contestants whose Submissions earn the highest overall score, excluding, if applicable, the Popular Choice Finalist, will become potential Finalists. The Popular Choice Finalist is not eligible to be a Finalist. If the Popular Choice Finalist is one of the nine Contestants whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores from the Judges, then the Contestant whose Submission earns the tenth overall highest score, will become a potential Finalist.\u00a0\nE. In the event of a tie between two or more Submissions, the tied Submission with the highest score in the first criterion listed above shall be deemed the higher scoring Submission. In the event any ties remain, this process will be repeated by comparing the tied Submissions\u2019 scores on the second, third, fourth, and fifth criterion listed above, respectively. If two or more Submissions are tied on all six criteria, the panel of Judges will vote on the tied submissions (the \u201cTie-Breaker Criteria\u201d).\nF. A Contestant\u2019s likelihood of becoming a Finalist will depend primarily on the number and quality of Submissions, as determined by the Judges using the criteria in these Official Rules.\u00a0\nA. Voting on the Competition Website during the Public Voting Period will determine the potential Popular Choice Finalist.\nB. The potential Popular Choice Finalist will be determined on the basis of the verified vote counts, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion. The Sponsor and the Administrator reserve the right to extend or change the Public Voting Period at any time for any reason.\nC. One (1) potential finalist will be selected based solely on the highest number of verified votes received from Registered Visitors on the Competition Website (the \u201cPopular Choice Finalist\u201d).\u00a0 If there is a tie between or among two or more Submissions for the Popular Choice Finalist, the higher scoring Submission will be determined by the Tie-Breaker Criteria (described in Section 9 E above).\u00a0\u00a0\nD. The likelihood of being selected to as the Popular Choice Finalist depends on the total number of verified votes received on the Submissions relative to other Submissions.\u00a0\u00a0\nE. Use of an automated process or similar device to submit an electronic vote is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to circumvent the one-vote limit per Submission, including the use of multiple email addresses or any form of automated vote processes will subject all votes from the person or entity to disqualification. The Sponsor and/or the Administrator reserves the right to disqualify any Contestant at their sole discretion, if a Contestant receives multiple and/or irregular votes from the same user or users, or receives votes in a manner that otherwise may indicate automated or non-automated vote manipulation. If the voting process for the Popular Choice Finalist fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, the Sponsor and/or the Administrator at their sole discretion reserve the right to determine the Popular Choice Finalist by using non-suspect votes, or by any other means the Administrator deems appropriate.\u00a0 Contestants may not pay or otherwise compensate anyone or provide any other type of consideration in exchange for votes. If no alternative means of determining a winner of the Popular Choice Finalist is available, Administrator may eliminate the Popular Choice Finalist or select one addition Finalist.\u00a0\u00a0\nA. Finalists will attend a judging event (the \u201cDemo Day\u201d) where they will give presentations and demonstrate their Technologies to the Judges and members of the public. Each Finalist will be provided with one coaching session to streamline their Demo Day presentation.\u00a0 Sponsor shall have the sole ability to determine the date and the location of the coaching sessions and Demo Day. The Demo Day will occur on or about July 10, 2013. Failure to attend the Demo Day and give a presentation may result in immediate disqualification and selection of an alternative Finalist.\u00a0\u00a0\nB. Judges will rate all ten Finalists at the Demo Day using the following criterion:\u00a0\n(i) \n(including clarity and persuasiveness of the presentation and Technology demonstrations).\u00a0\nC. A Finalist\u2019s score on the \u201cPresentation quality\u201d criterion will be added to the scores the Finalist received from the Judges on the five criteria listed above in Section 9 (C) and used to determine the Finalists. All six criteria will be weighted equally to determine each Finalist\u2019s final overall score.\nD.
