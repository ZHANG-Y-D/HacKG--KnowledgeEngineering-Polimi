Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and racist, sexist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for this event. If at any point you see a fellow hacker being harassed, it\u2019s your responsibility to talk to the nearest hackathon organizer.\n2)\u00a0\n\u00a0Without them nothing would be possible. Take some time out of your work to go meet and speak with them. If they come over to talk to you look up from your work and give them a bit of your time. They're here for you! \u00a0Show them you appreciate it.\u00a0\n3)\u00a0\n\u00a0We want to ensure that all participants start off on the same footing and we also want to preserve the true nature of a hackathon. You are, however, free to make plans, create wireframes, and brainstorm prior to the event.\nThe only exception to this rule is that you may use legally licensed material and tools that are freely available to the public. Some examples of these would be: public domain images, creative commons music, open source libraries, and existing APIs and platforms. Failure to comply may result in the offending team's disqualification.\n\u00a0Bring your blueprints, build at the hackathon. It\u2019s the only way we can compare hacks on a level playing field and fairly award prizes. It\u2019s what lets you say \u201cI built this at a hackathon\u201d.\u00a0\n4)\u00a0\n\u00a0Hackathons are amazing, and so are you. We\u2019re so happy you\u2019re able to hack with us and be a part of our amazing community.\u00a0\n5)\u00a0\n\u00a0Hacking unites people from across the world and from different cultural norms, nationalities, and backgrounds. Be prepared not only to learn something new from your hack, but also from the amazing people around you. \u00a0Be mindful of the fact that certain content and actions can make the people around you uncomfortable.\u00a0\n\u00a0They'll review it with the team and notify you if you should go forward. Don't waste 36 hours on a \u00a0hack that won't be allowed to demo.\n6)\u00a0\n\u00a0Never be afraid of competing based on where you come from or have preconceptions of grandeur because you come from a great school. One can achieve greatness at any time. You simply have to see it and grab it.", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "$400 Delta (Airline of your choice) Gift Card", "prize-title": "MHacks Grand Prize"}, {"prize-content": "Echo Show", "prize-title": "MHacks 2nd Place Prize"}, {"prize-content": "$75 Excitation Gift Card", "prize-title": "MHacks 3rd Place Prize"}, {"prize-content": "Get creative by designing the DRIVING EXPERIENCE of tomorrow -", "prize-title": "THE COOLEST NEW DRIVING XPERIENCE IDEA - HONDA!
