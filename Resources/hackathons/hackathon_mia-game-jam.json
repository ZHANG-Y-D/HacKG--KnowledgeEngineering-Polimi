All members must be involved in the project ( either designing, programming or creating audio/visuals.) If you're looking for fellow teammates, find participants on the MIA GAME JAM facebook page. Others are looking for teams, too!\n\u00a0\n\n\u200b\nTo \u00a0preserve the true nature of a game jam and ensure a level field for all contestants, all code, design, art, music, SFX, and assets must be created during the duration of the event. The only exception would be material that is freely available to the public. Some examples of this would be: public domain images, creative commons music, open source libraries. You are, however, free to make plans, create wireframes, and brainstorm prior to the event. We take this rule very seriously. Failure to comply may result in the offending team's disqualification. If your team qualifies for prizes or is in the top five, the team will be subject to a code review to verify that there was no foul play.\n\u00a0\n\n\u200b\nThe exception to the above rule is that you are encouraged to use 3rd party services, APIs, open source projects, libraries, and frameworks. Many of our past contestants have taken advantage of the various offerings from our event partners to great effect.\n\u00a0\n\n\u200b\nAll teams retain full ownership of what they have created during the Hackathon. MIAGAMEJAM is here to help entrepreneurs realize their dreams, not destroy them.\n\u200b\n\nThere will be no alcohol served or allowed at the event.\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n*Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and racist, sexist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for this event*.\n\u200b\n* Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\nIn the spirit of innovation and inclusiveness, there may be minors participating in the event. Keep this in mind when choosing a location to work, and mention to the organizers that your content is explicit if you\u2019d like to submit for judging. You will be pitching to judges and other attendees after the non-explicit content. You will present your idea to an audience who is explicitly prepared to experience your presentation in a safe and/or designated area.\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\nWe welcome attendees from all backgrounds. This event is about increasing the overall amount of innovation, partnership, and engagement in the developer community.\n\u200b\n", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "Lunch meeting with Alienware manager Frank Azor.
