This is a very diverse environment, made up of many races, religions, sexual orientations, genders, and gender identities. Any behavior or presentation that objectifies or belittles others will be halted, with the presenters immediately disqualified and removed from the event. Don\u2019t behave in a way or present anything you wouldn\u2019t be proud to have your parents see.\u00a0\n\nMajoran is a coworking communtiy.\u00a0The organisers and the coworking residents trust you as the participant not to remove or use any items that are already existing in the space without consent of the property owner, or damage any items. We trust that you are cool dudes (and dudettes) who just want to hack an awesome product.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a Powerpoint-athon! Build and demonstrate a working project, don\u2019t just show us screenshots and slides.\n\nThe project you present must be coded entirely during the Hackathon. The only exceptions are for publicly available frameworks/APIs and open-source code that has been available for at least a month. If it feels shady to use the code, don\u2019t.\n\nFinalists will have their code audited to make sure it\u2019s all new and legit, by a developer appointed by SouthStart. Your code belongs to you and we won\u2019t share it with anyone, but we will want to see it if you win.\n\nUse Git or an equivalent to track your code as you write it. It\u2019s good practice, and if it comes down to an audit, it\u2019ll help you prove your code is new.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an opportunity to promote your team\u2019s pre-existing product. Don\u2019t tack one tiny feature onto your existing product and call it a day.\n\nYou must present your hack as described in your submission. You have 1 minute to demo. We want to see what you've built, not PowerPoint slides!\n\nWe\u2019re limiting the number of members per team at 5, in the interest of keeping things fair.\u00a0\nAlso, we strongly suggest that each hacker gives their attention to just one team, rather than trying to be a part of multiple projects; we want to see your best work, and it\u2019s hard to do your best work when you\u2019re jumping from table to table.\n\nAsking for advice from API, platform and language supporters is encouraged.\n\u00a0\n\nTHE TERMS & CONDITIONS FOR SOUTHSTART HACKFEST 2014\n1.
