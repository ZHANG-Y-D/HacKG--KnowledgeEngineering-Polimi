Student status will be verified by a transcript before prize money is given.\nWinners are responsible for reporting and paying all applicable federal, state and local taxes.\n\nSubmissions will be judged by an expert judging panel as well as the public.\u00a0 The expert judging panel will determine winners of the Best Overall Application, Student Awards, and the Peak Energy Usage Award, and the Popular Choice App will be determined by public vote on\n\u00a0The judging panel will consist of experts and managers from DOE, the sponsoring organizations, other Federal agencies, and the software design and development industry, and will select the Best Overall App and Student Award based upon the following criteria:\nThis award will go to the app with the highest scores in three criteria used to select the Best Overall App that best addresses energy usage during peak demand, by helping users understand and reduce the amount of energy they use during peak demand periods.\u00a0 Peak demand is defined as the time during the day when demand is highest on the electricity grid, generally 12:00 PM to 6:00 PM on weekdays. This award can be won in addition to another prize category.\nA preliminary panel of judges selected by DOE will initially screen submissions. The preliminary panel will judge the Submissions on the criteria identified above to select finalist Submissions. The Finalist Submissions will be scored by the finalist panel of judges on a scale of 1-10 (ten being the highest) in a range of categories that reflect the above criteria.\u00a0 The average score in each category will be computed, and the average scores will be combined to compute a total score for every app. The app with the highest total score overall will receive the Best Overall Application Grand Prize, and the app with the highest total score among student developers will receive the Student Award Grand Prize, unless the app with the highest score among student developers would also win the Best Overall App Grand Prize, in which case that app will win the Best Overall Application Grand Prize only, and the second highest total score among the student developers will win the Student Award Grand Prize. The second and third prizes will be awarded in a similar manner, with no app winning more than one Overall or Student Award. For the Peak Energy Usage Award, all that submissions that address peak demand energy usage will be compared. The app with the highest average score across all three criteria will win the award. Judges may be named after commencement of the Competition.\u00a0\nA Contestant\u2019s likelihood of winning will depend primarily on the number and quality of all of the Submissions, as determined by the Judges using the criteria below. The approximate dates for the judging panel are between May 15, 2012 at 8:00 PM ET and May 21, 2012 at 5:00 PM ET.\n\u00a0The public will have the opportunity to select a Popular Choice Award winner, which will be determined by public vote on the \n website during the Public Voting Period (May 17 2012 at 8:00am ET to May 31, 2012 at 8:00pm ET Update: Public voting period extended to May 31.).\u00a0 Each registered visitor will be limited to one vote per day for each of their favorite submissions.\u00a0Any attempt to circumvent the one-vote limit per Submission per day or to use any form of automated vote process will subject all votes from the person to disqualification. \u00a0DOE may disqualify the votes and/or submissions of any users or Contestants seeking to defraud the voting process.\u00a0 The app with the most valid votes will be deemed the Popular Choice Award Grand Prize winner, and the app with the second most votes will be deemed the Popular Choice Award Second Prize winner. An app may win either of the Popular Choice Awards and one of the Best Overall or Student Awards and the Peak Energy Usage Award. If the voting process for the Popular Choice Awards fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, DOE in their sole discretion reserves the right to use another means to determine the winner of the Popular Choice Awards. Contestants may not pay or otherwise compensate anyone or provide any other type of consideration, in exchange for votes.\nPublic votes may be displayed on the competition website, on a real-time basis, before being verified for integrity. These unverified votes will not necessarily reflect accurately the voting for the Popular Choice Awards.\nThe winners of the Popular Choice Awards will be determined on the basis of the verified vote counts, as determined by DOE. DOE reserves the right to extend the voting period at any time for any reason.\n\nThe Finalist Submissions will be\u00a0judged by the judges identified in the challenge details or by another qualified panel selected by DOE at its sole discretion.
