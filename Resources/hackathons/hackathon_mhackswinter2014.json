It's for those of you who see problems and want to tackle them, using existing skills, and augmenting them with the skills of those around you. MHacks III will be the best place to do that, and we can't wait to see what you make of it.", "hackathon-number-of-prizes": "17", "hackathon-id": "mhackswinter2014", "hackathon-judges": [{"judge-role": "", "judge-name": "MHacks Judging Panel"}], "hackathon-number-of-judges": "1", "hackathon-eligibility": "\nTeams can be anywhere from one to four people.
