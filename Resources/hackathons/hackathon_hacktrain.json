Treat all other hackers with utmost respect.\u200bBe kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and racist, sexist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for this event. If at any point you see a fellow hacker being harassed, it\u2019s your responsibility to talk to the nearest hackathon organizer.\n2.) Treat our sponsors with the same respect.\u200bWithout them, nothing would be possible. Take some time out of your work to go meet and speak with them. If they come over to talk to you, look up from your work and give them a bit of your time. They're here for you! Show them you appreciate it.\n3.) Teams can be anywhere from one to four members (unless otherwise specified).\u200bAll teams retain full ownership of what they have created during the hackathon.\n4.) The hackathon is a walled garden. To ensure a level playing field for all contestants, all code, design, art, music, SFX, and assets must be created during the duration of the hackathon. \u200bWe want to ensure that all participants start off on the same footing and we also want to preserve the true nature of a hackathon. You are, however, free to make plans, create wireframes, and brainstorm prior to the event. The only exception to this rule would include material that is freely available to the public. Some examples of this would be: public domain images, Creative Commons music, open source libraries, our sponsors APIs, data sets and platforms, and the like. Failure to comply may result in the offending team's disqualification. TL;DR: Bring your blueprints, build at the hackathon. It\u2019s the only way we can compare hacks on a level playing field and fairly award prizes. It\u2019s also what lets you say \u201cI built this at a hackathon.\"\n5.) Have fun.\u200bHackathons are amazing, and so are you. We\u2019re so happy you\u2019re able to hack with us and be a part of our amazing community.\n6.) Open your mind.\u200bHacking unites people from across the world from different cultural norms, nationalities, and backgrounds. Be prepared not only to learn something new from your hack, but also from the amazing people around you. Be mindful of the fact that certain content and actions can make the people around you uncomfortable. If your hack contains material that might cross that boundary, talk to a member of the organizing team for a second or third opinion.\u200bWe'll let you know if you should consider rethinking your hack.\n7.) Be the change you want to see in your local community.\u200bNever be afraid of competing based on where you come from or have preconceptions of grandeur because you come from a great school. At any time one can achieve greatness. You simply have to see it and seize it.\n8.) Use the sponsors APIs and Data Sets appropriately as mentioned below: Any activity which disrespects our partners, project donors and individual users will not be tolerated. Don\u2019t misrepresent the data. To the best of your ability, please reflect data from the API accurately. The data represents a project (or organisation) communicating its story: what it hopes to accomplish, funding it needs, current progress, etc. Don\u2019t, for example, create an application using our sponsors APIs/data that misrepresents what they do, however just or seemingly related. The data is there to help a particular project, or promote the work of a particular organisation: please use it to do the same. The data, content and API\u2019s provided by our sponsors are not for commercial use.Our sponsors are opening their APIs and making data and content available for you to explore and build new technologies with, but only during the hackathon. To the extent that you have incorporated any of these sponsor resources into any technology, you may continue to use such resources to showcase your technology after the hackathon, but you must not use these resources for any other purposes or for commercial purposes either during or after the hackathon, unless you come to written agreement with the sponsor. If you have a commercial use which you would like to work on together with us, don\u2019t hesitate to talk to the sponsors. Respect the API servers and others who may be using them at the same time. The more calls you make to the API, the less resources there are available for other developers (and yes, the more operating expenses for our sponsors go up). Don\u2019t request data you don\u2019t need; cache data when possible; refresh cached data only when it expires, or you hit a cache miss (e.g., you come across an image URL template previously unknown to you). If your application is slow because you are making a lot of API calls or the API calls take a long time to return, you\u2019re likely doing something which conflicts with how we\u2019ve built the products.\u00a0", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "1st Place"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "2nd Place"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "3rd Place"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=London, UK", "hackathon-url": "https://hacktrain.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": "TBA"}], "hackathon-location-address": "London, UK", "hackathon-description-header": "Europe's premium hackathon on a train!", "hackathon-prizes-total": "0", "hackathon-location-description": "London", "hackathon-end-date": "", "has-projects": "False"}
