After you register you must verify your email address via the registration email sent to the email entered in the registration form. Registered Contestants will then be able to enter a Submission. In the event of a dispute as to any registration, the authorized account holder of the email address used to register will be deemed to be the Contestant\u2019s. The \u201cauthorized account holder\u201d is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Potential winners may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder. Contestants must comply with the Terms of Use of NYC.gov Data Mine. Failure to do so could result in disqualification from the Competition at the Sponsors\u2019 sole discretion.\nEach Contestant will be required to provide the following as part of the Submission:\nContestants will own the intellectual property rights to Submissions but the City, Sponsors and Administrator will maintain a royalty free license to, without limitation: a) Post the Submissions on \n; b) Make the Submissions available for the course of the Competition and 12 months after the conclusion of the Competition Submission Period; and c) Utilize the Submissions for noncommercial purposes for a period of 12 months after the conclusion of the Competition Submission Period.\nOnce a Contestant enters a Submission, the Submission cannot be modified in any way until after the Judging is complete.\nSubmissions will be posted on \n\u00a0on a rolling basis after being screened by the Administrator for basic functionality, accuracy of messaging, and integrity (i.e., security). The Administrator has the right to request access to the Application in person or via any reasonable manner to verify the Application functions and operates as stated in the Submission. Failure by a Contestant to honor such a request will result in immediate disqualification of the Submission. All Contestants will have equal access to Submissions posted on the website. Non-Contestants interested in the Competition are also encouraged to register on \n. Registration will be required in order to receive updates on the Competition and vote for the Popular Choice Award. Registered visitors will be able to vote for their favorite Submissions. The public voting will take place between on or about February 9, 2011 at 10:00 AM EST and March 9, 2011 at 5:00 PM EST. Public voting will determine the winner of the Popular Choice Award. Each registered visitor is able to vote for their favorite Submissions, but may only vote for a Submission once during the voting period. Use of an automated process or similar device to submit an electronic vote is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to circumvent the one vote limit per Submission or to use automated vote process will subject all votes from the person to disqualification. If a Contestant receives multiple and/or irregular votes from the same user or users, including but not limited to, votes generated by a robotic, programmed, script, macro, other automated means or other source, the Sponsors and/or Administrators reserves the right to disqualify the Contestant in their sole discretion. If the voting process for the Popular Choice Award fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, the Sponsors and/or Administrators in their sole discretion reserves the right to use another means to determine the winner of the Popular Choice Award, i.e. random selection or appointing a panel of judges. Contestants may not pay people or provide any other type of consideration in exchange for votes. Any Contestant who violates the ban on paying or providing consideration in exchange for votes will be disqualified. Public votes may be displayed on the competition website, on a real-time basis, before being verified for integrity. These unverified votes do not necessarily reflect accurately the winner of the Popular Choice Award. The winner of the Popular Choice Award will be the entrant(s) who are contacted directly by the Administrator or Sponsors after votes have been verified. Sponsors reserve the right to modify the voting period at anytime for any reason. Submissions that are competing for the Large Organization Recognition Award or City Talent Award are not eligible to win any of the Popular Choice Awards.\nSubmissions will initially be screened by a qualified internal panel selected by the Sponsors at their sole discretion. The internal panel will judge the Submissions on the criteria identified below to select finalist Submissions. Then the finalist Submissions will be judged by an expert judging panel determined by the Sponsors. Sponsors reserve the right to substitute or modify the judging panel at any time for any reason. Judges do have the right to withdrawal without advance notice in the event of extenuating circumstances beyond their control. Judges will be fair and impartial. A judge may elect to recuse him or herself from judging a Submission, if in the judge\u2019s sole discretion it is not appropriate for him or her to judge that particular Submission because of a past or current relationship with that particular Contestant. A Submission will not be at a disadvantage if one or more judge recuses him or herself. Odds of winning depend on the number of eligible Submissions received and the quality of the Submissions. The approximate dates for the judging panel are between February 9, 2011 at 10:00 AM EST and March 9, 2011 at 5 PM EST.\nCriteria\nThe eight (8) Contestants whose Submissions earn the highest overall score will win the prizes identified below in section 7.
