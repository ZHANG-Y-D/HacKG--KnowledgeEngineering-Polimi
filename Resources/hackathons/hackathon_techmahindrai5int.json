Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.\nRefer below for more detail.\nHarassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.\nPhotography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).\nParticipants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.\nAs this is a hackathon we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our hackathon are equally subjective to the anti-harassment policy.\nSponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.\nIf you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of hackathon staff immediately.\nHackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.\nIf a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the hackathon with no refund (if applicable)..\nWe expect participants to follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues and hackathon-related social events.\n\nCopy inspired by the hackcodeofconduct.org", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "One DJI Phantom for each team member.", "prize-title": "Best application for Mahindra Genze or Mahindra Non Profit"}, {"prize-content": "One iPad mini for each team member.", "prize-title": "Best use of Kandy APIs"}, {"prize-content": "One Kindle Paper White for each team member.", "prize-title": "Best use of Orchestra platform"}, {"prize-content": "One Fire TV for each team member.", "prize-title": "Open Category"}, {"prize-content": "One Fitbit for each team member.", "prize-title": "Best use of connect2.me APIs"}, {"prize-content": "One Google Chromecast for each team member", "prize-title": "Consolation Prizes"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=Richardson, TX 75080, USA", "hackathon-url": "https://techmahindrai5int.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}, {"judging-criterion": ""}], "hackathon-location-address": "Richardson, TX 75080, USA", "hackathon-description-header": "TechM i5 Event - Internet of Things!", "hackathon-prizes-total": "$4,520", "hackathon-location-description": "", "hackathon-end-date": "", "has-projects": "False"}
