Teams can work on existing projects but during the demo the team must clearly outline the part that was written during the hackathon and it shall be only judged on this part. Additionally open-source frameworks and code that is available to everyone may be used.\u00a0Judges and organizers have to be granted a look on the source code on request.\nTeams of up to 4 humans are allowed.\nAs we are hacking on a university campus, we need to be able to clearly identify participants and non-participants. That's why we ask everyone to wear the badges we hand out and clearly display the badge with their name. It is also not permitted to pass them on to non-participants.\n\nIn order to participate in the actual competition and present your hack your team must be registered on the official project submission platform of the event before the submission deadline.\nUntil submission deadline all teams must be registered, and their submission must include \n and a link to the repository. Video submissions showing a demo of your project are optional.\n\nThe ownership for everything built at the event remains with the team and the team is free to do with it what it wants, with respect to disclaimers for company challenges that indicate otherwise.\nIn order to participate in the competition it is necessary that you demo your hack. Slides are not allowed. Don't be scared to present unfinished hacks. You can still have a chance to win :)\nThe judging of the hackathon will have two phases. In the first phase every team has the chance to present to some judges. Afterwards the best teams will be chosen to present on stage in front of all participants and the final jury. Everyone who presents in front of the final jury starts with a blank slate. Previous scores will not be counted for the final decision.\nIn both cases the decisions of the jury members and organizers are final and shall not be reconsidered.\nWe want a fair competition and are not planning to disqualify anyone however if any of the following things is violated we sadly have to disqualify you (and in cases your team):", "hackathon-prizes": [{"prize-content": "Withings Activit\u00e9 Steel: Activity tracking watches + swiss chocolates", "prize-title": "LauzHack Grand Winner"}, {"prize-content": "Kobo Aura 2: E-Readers + swiss chocolates", "prize-title": "LauzHack Runner-Up"}, {"prize-content": "Sony SRS-XB2: Wireless portable speakers + swiss chocolates", "prize-title": "LauzHack Second Runner-Up"}, {"prize-content": "FujiFilm Instax Mini with photo paper (Instant printing cameras)", "prize-title": "Organizer's Favourite Hack"}, {"prize-content": "Complete Logitech gaming peripheral sets", "prize-title": "Logitech Challenge Winner"}, {"prize-content": "Hubsan X4 Plus: Drones", "prize-title": "AXA Challenge Winner"}, {"prize-content": "Hubsan X4 Plus: Drones", "prize-title": "Axa Challenge Runner Up"}, {"prize-content": "Hubsan X4 Plus: Drones", "prize-title": "Axa Challenge 3rd Place"}, {"prize-content": "Horizon Zugo: Drones", "prize-title": "Gamaya Challenge Winner"}, {"prize-content": "", "prize-title": "IBM  Challenge Winner"}, {"prize-content": "Microsoft Azure backpacks + Raspberry Pi kits", "prize-title": "Microsoft  Challenge Winner"}, {"prize-content": "Complete developper Raspberry Pi kits", "prize-title": "Openfood Challenge Winner"}, {"prize-content": "Raspberry Pi + accessories", "prize-title": "SBB CFF FFS Challenge Winner"}, {"prize-content": "\"The effective engineer\": Books + 100\u20ac RyanAir vouchers", "prize-title": "Skyscanner Challenge Winner"}, {"prize-content": "Lego Mindstorms: Programmable robots", "prize-title": "Swisscom Challenge Winner"}, {"prize-content": "HackHarassment Swag Bags", "prize-title": "#HackHarassment"}, {"prize-content": "1 TB Hard Drives", "prize-title": "Amazon Web Services - Best Use of AWS"}, {"prize-content": "Domain.com Swag Bags", "prize-title": "Best Domain Name from Domain.com"}, {"prize-content": "Portable speakers", "prize-title": "Bloomberg's Favourite Hack"}], "hackathon-location-google-maps": "https://maps.google.com/?q=EPFL, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland", "hackathon-url": "https://lauzhack.devpost.com/", "hackathon-judging-criteria": [{"judging-criterion": "How impressive is your hack from a technical perspective?
