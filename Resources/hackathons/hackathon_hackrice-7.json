Earlier this week, one of our developers used our iOS application to record a flight that he took around the Houston area. The data is available for free on GitHub. Your challenge is to take our flight data and reconstruct the flight. Then, display the flight data or analyze it in a unique way. Can you browse the flight from your desk using augmented reality? Replay the flight from the pilot's perspective using virtual reality? Can you analyze the data to detect takeoff, landing, climb, or descent? What about 360\u00ba turns, loops, or crashes? Show us your best and win Apple Store gift cards for you and your team.
