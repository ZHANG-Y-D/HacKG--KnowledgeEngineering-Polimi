What I found interesting though is in both instances, one of the first thing the bot begin to develop was profanity, or adult themed stories.

Essentially I ended up putting different key phrases and had to \"seek\" a certain set of adjectives or variables in order for the bot to learn. The bot learns mainly through the keyphrases you assign but gets smarter through transcript history. The chattron bot on the other hand took much quicker to build because it has a mapping ability for its keyphrases and an already build in simple SDK.", "hackathon-url": "https://mhacksnano.devpost.com/", "project-title": "1 Day Chatbot Builds (AI Entities)", "project-inspiration": "MHacks Nano is an only few days online Hackathon and I wanted to be able to get something done quick. I also like developing good AI applications but in the timeframe for this hack, that wasn't much of an option. Instead I used Personality Forge's API and also tested it against other competitors by compiling a different Chatbot. Using different Key phrases, you are able to develop something called AI Script and their API already comes in with an easy to use built in SHA 256 encryption key.", "project-lessons-learned": "One thing is for certain, AI shouldn't be given emotion or the ability to think for itself in regards to human behavior.", "project-accomplishments": "I am proud I got started on something for MHacks Nano, even though it is remarkably small, more simple, and less dev work then most of my other projects.", "project-likes": "3", "hackathon-name": "MHacks Nano", "project-subtitle": "Building two bots using paraphrases and an AI script genetator, then testing their responses", "project-github-url": "", "project-number-of-comments": "0", "team-size": "1", "project-creation-timestamp": "2017-06-21T14:51:05-04:00", "team": [{"participant-bubble": "", "participant-name": "Andrew Kamal", "participant-desc": "I am Andrew Kamal of AndSocialREW Gaming and Publishing as well as StartHub Messenger.
