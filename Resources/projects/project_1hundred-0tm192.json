Each page of the application is an activity in android studio.

Other times, we forgot to include the line which actually receives the location of the user (we sent out a team member to run a mile twice and they had returned without any information actually uploaded). Furthermore, some issues included not importing libraries and having activites run on the same page which would cause things to overlap each other.", "project-future-plans": "Monetary penalties is just one form of incentives we would like to offer our customers in the future. In having daily and weekly penalties, we have attempted to create a system that develops the habit of daily exercise. To further instill this principle, we plan to give our customers the option of locking their phones and other electronic devices (hooked up to a Google Service system) during a particular time in a day (which is decided that the beginning of the week). \nWe plan to offer integration features for customers with Fitbits and other Wearable technology that will allow them to track their heart rate, pulse and speed. We would offer to incentivise these other measurements to our competitive trainees to improve or maintain their game daily.", "project-purpose": "When a customer signs up for our services, we require that It utilizes Android\u2019s built in GPS services to calculate the distance that you travel. Using Java (Android Studio),  as well as Google play services it charges the user weekly if they didn't run the specified amount. We also used different activities that go on different pages to have the code run easily and be easily navigable.", "hackathon-url": "https://hacktrin.devpost.com/", "project-title": "1HUNDRED%", "project-inspiration": "Even in a market as big as the productivity and fitness/health industry, in our research, we have found few apps that offer a solution for those who have trouble sticking to their goals and resolutions. In our personal experiences with time management and the chaos of our daily lives, sometimes fitness comes secondary to everything else that is going on. Fitness is evidently a major global issue indicating by the astonishing obesity rates in the country.
