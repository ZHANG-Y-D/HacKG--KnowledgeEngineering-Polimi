The Facebook bot worked great! Until I tried integrating the API (which had wrappers for Perl, PHP, and Python...none of which I had chosen for my app). I used Postman to test my API calls, which helped a lot.\nThe node.js app also kept crashing on Heroku if I used promises for some reason (ugh). So getting the messages to be posted in the correct order was a pain.\nWhen I tried displaying all of the servers on an account, I didn't realize I was dealing with a string instead of an array. So when I went to iterate over everything from i=0 to i=body.length, I crashed my Facebook, Heroku, and phone. Oh my.
